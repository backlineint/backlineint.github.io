I\'ve enjoyed talking about this topic within the Drupal community recently because it really gets people (myself included) thinking about the possibilities and challenging their perceptions of what a site can be. It has also introduced me to the interesting and difficult to describe phenomenon of people "thinking" audibly. Happens a bit on the podcast as well.</p> '},relationships:{image:null},created:1543966072}},pathContext:{slug:"/link/talking-drupal-188-static-site-generation/"}}}});
