We're calling our pretend brewery 'Antcolony Brewing' - a stretch, but this is a combination of two of our kids names - Anthony and Colin (get it?) The beer itself is called 'Coyote Defense League Pale Ale' due to the surprising Coyote problem we've had in the neighborhood this year.</p>\\r\\n<p>Looking forward to another brew soon. Looking like something dark next time around.</p>\"},\"relationships\":{\"image\":{\"localFile\":{\"childImageSharp\":{\"sizes\":{\"base64\":\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\",\"aspectRatio\":0.75,\"src\":\"/static/02bf366e30f2109414c6479968f41c8f-7b4969a8fff234546240e67cf2ba667f-42807.jpg\",\"srcSet\":\"/static/02bf366e30f2109414c6479968f41c8f-7b4969a8fff234546240e67cf2ba667f-960f9.jpg 313w,\\n/static/02bf366e30f2109414c6479968f41c8f-7b4969a8fff234546240e67cf2ba667f-c36f2.jpg 625w,\\n/static/02bf366e30f2109414c6479968f41c8f-7b4969a8fff234546240e67cf2ba667f-42807.jpg 1250w,\\n/static/02bf366e30f2109414c6479968f41c8f-7b4969a8fff234546240e67cf2ba667f-9f2a8.jpg 1500w\",\"sizes\":\"(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px\"}}}}},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/note/coyote-defense-league-pale-ale/\"},\"post_type\":\"note\",\"created\":1539705836}},{\"node\":{\"id\":\"49e2c13b-76d9-430f-a2fe-258110ee54bf\",\"title\":\"Learning How to Adapt - Developing Up\",\"link\":\"http://www.developingup.com/36\",\"body\":{\"value\":\"<p>Enjoyed listening back to this chat about adapting as a developer that I had with <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/mikemiles86\\\">Mike Miles</a> for his <a href=\\\"http://www.developingup.com/\\\">Developing Up podcast</a>. We end up pretty far away from some of the traditional dev topics you might expect, but I think that is the improviser in me applying  'yes, and...' to our conversation. Mike does a great job reinforcing how some of my more tangential thoughts relate back to adaptability.
