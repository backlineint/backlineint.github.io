I had a chance to try it out yesterday and I must say that the hype seems pretty warranted.</p>\r\n<p>I often call my blog the least important site on the internet, but the real winner of that award is <a href=\"http://www.campperry.fun/\">Camp Perry</a>, a blog that I created as a joke for the unofficial neighborhood camp that happens in my back yard every summer. I wanted to move the blog to Gatsby and also take better advantage of the campperry.fun domain than I could on my current Github Pages configuration. Seemed like as good an excuse as any to try out Netlify. After granting access to my github repo, Netlify was able to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Automatically determine that I had a Gatsby site, and configure the build process accordingly</li>\r\n<li>Deploy a new build whenever a commit was made to the master branch</li>\r\n<li>For each new pull request, create a deploy preview site that I could use to sanity check my changes</li>\r\n<li>Use my custom domain (this took a little configuration and was the hardest part, but mainly because I'm not great at domain stuff)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of that in a few minutes, and on the free tier. They also offer one click https, which I haven't gotten around to yet. Well worth checking out if you're looking for a place to host a static site build. I'd like to migrate this site to Netlify at some point as well to take advantage of some of the build automation and also https.</p>\r\n<p><em>Update</em>: with my custom domain stuff all squared away I was able to try the one click https features. One click to enable https via letsencrypt, a second click to force https on the site. Took about 90 seconds start to finish. And Netlify will autorenew my letsencrypt certificate before it expires. Pretty amazing.</p>"},relationships:{image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAANCAYAAACpUE5eAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAACRElEQVQ4y21TS2sUQRCenyx4FTx68qQBQRAvEb0oGMFbLhH0IGxIvARDdsfsY3be06+Zfs1ndc/uukh6+ajqHqr2q/qqkhEAExJ13UCQtdZCKgXOObz39CbAyNdaYxg0OsbACMMwUGSI3p8xIhF1hfz+D5S2UD0FBTsYyOAbF/2A4Pe7b9PdwrgR2vr4zZA1ziP5enqK148fodPAYlNhVXGsKxGxKhmWJUfbj+iIUISe0O78nGmKkSi4QSUskl4qiLaFUD0aJlC3DFXTouMSRADWj9E6stb9B/8PLgJI9h0YjME6XYBTz1Q/RBgqK/QtwDqHcRwfhCcYZ6EpxyEhLNG/W0BIOSXShgRydFdRrPBGcQ8mDMc4g56ESs7q73i2fIe5zpCaAi1nKHmDirBtSihHTOEwjCSEN5PdY3fvqIJGafDA8IJd4315jgt+jR/ZFVaLFe7SFOvNBnlRxnEJx4/+CEcM6Sd6h044yMEdlUwNVQaoacbqehKpp2ShBR3jsQVx0nYCGesO8J5aoywaoZGEfwznUt7isrxDtsmxJHabPEe2zbHJttjmBYqyQlU1kTXnIrJ0JOse2kzzmOybOlO3uCnm4KsWTVZDbBmKrEC6vI/l87ghHdq2IdX7o+043pUxMJwev7W/cJJ9xkl+hlf5FzxZvsWsu4VXoT9UuhrBpQeTZEVYQUkCWppXg6YzseRQ/qHk82qG5/MPeJF+xMv0E57+foOf1Q2U7El1GniytehpG2gBaIwaKQhDRHhnYXatxl9hf+WyJVFuIgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==",aspectRatio:1.5728346456692914,src:"/static/ebe53d5f14ad4b399519c2178003f54d-65da9898fa7738e3967dc8fcb2506598-7f5d2.png",srcSet:"/static/ebe53d5f14ad4b399519c2178003f54d-65da9898fa7738e3967dc8fcb2506598-a1b93.png 313w,\n/static/ebe53d5f14ad4b399519c2178003f54d-65da9898fa7738e3967dc8fcb2506598-f7d23.png 625w,\n/static/ebe53d5f14ad4b399519c2178003f54d-65da9898fa7738e3967dc8fcb2506598-7f5d2.png 799w",sizes:"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px"}}}}},created:1528753026}},pathContext:{slug:"/post/a-first-taste-of-netlify/"}}}});
