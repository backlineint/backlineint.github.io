I usually have a pretty good handle on what I want to accomplish in the upcoming year, along with a formal resolution. But this year, nothing. Initially that seemed terrifying, but the more I think about it, that openness and lack of expectation is an exciting resolution in and of itself.</p>\r\n<p>Standing in my now <em>mostly</em> finished kitchen I also came up with another late breaking resolution. 2019 is going to be the year of intentional home improvements. Rather than letting a flood force me into it, I'm going to try to proactively decorate, improve and declutter. It is pleasantly (mostly) non-technical, and I can tackle it in tiny chunks throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p>Wishing everyone a happy and productive 2019 full of dry kitchens.</p> "},relationships:{image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.3325545171339563,src:"/static/bc4109a22f50873da49408b523d0a915-ee8d7cc9338c16ed2c4b9bc8817e39b9-42807.jpg",srcSet:"/static/bc4109a22f50873da49408b523d0a915-ee8d7cc9338c16ed2c4b9bc8817e39b9-960f9.jpg 313w,\n/static/bc4109a22f50873da49408b523d0a915-ee8d7cc9338c16ed2c4b9bc8817e39b9-c36f2.jpg 625w,\n/static/bc4109a22f50873da49408b523d0a915-ee8d7cc9338c16ed2c4b9bc8817e39b9-42807.jpg 1250w,\n/static/bc4109a22f50873da49408b523d0a915-ee8d7cc9338c16ed2c4b9bc8817e39b9-dbc5e.jpg 1875w,\n/static/bc4109a22f50873da49408b523d0a915-ee8d7cc9338c16ed2c4b9bc8817e39b9-6e234.jpg 2500w,\n/static/bc4109a22f50873da49408b523d0a915-ee8d7cc9338c16ed2c4b9bc8817e39b9-98489.jpg 3422w",sizes:"(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px"}}}}},created:1546524528}},pathContext:{slug:"/post/intentional-home-improvements/"}}}});
