Heard great things about the efforts around Drupal 9 readiness as well.</li>\r\n<li>This was my first year involved as an organizer. I feel good about the execution of the camp and my role in it.

Didn\'t know that vertical mode was a thing? A small subset of often retro games support it. To try out the grip I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/arcade-archives-donkey-kong-switch">Arcade Archives: Donkey Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/namco-museum-switch">Namco Museum</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pinball-fx3-switch">Pinball FX3</a>. All told, I spent much more on games than the $12 that the grip costs.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, it works extremely well for the games that support vertical mode. It isn\'t something that I\'ll use that often, but I love having yet another configuration of this versatile device.
