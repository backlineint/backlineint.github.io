This week the organizers apparently ran into a pretty major snag with some budgeting issues with the venue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/midcamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#midcamp</a> just received some bad news from our venue. If you want to see this camp continue, please strongly consider sponsorship. We need all the help we can get right now: <a href="https://t.co/xBG0xx8DKz">https://t.co/xBG0xx8DKz</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Thull (@kevinjthull) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinjthull/status/961675493199220736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2018</a></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clarification regarding <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/midcamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#midcamp</a> news: Since we just found out we won&#39;t qualify for our venue discount for this year, we are looking to raise an additional $15,000 in sponsorship before 2/15 before making drastic cuts.</p>&mdash; Kevin Thull (@kevinjthull) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinjthull/status/961698243808825344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2018</a></blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, MidCamp is a really important part of staying connected with the Chicago-area Drupal community.  It is also the first Drupal event I ever presented at, and <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/hot-jamstack-lessons-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">I\'m scheduled to speak again</a> this year. I\'d really hate to see MidCamp have to scale back and not be the MidCamp we all know it can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways you can help. If you have a company (or a rich uncle) that could <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/become-a-sponsor">sponsor</a>, that could make a huge difference. If you have the means to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/midcamp-2018-midwest-drupal-camp-chicago-illinois-tickets-41173372666#tickets">become an individual sponsor</a>, that would help too. Word is that they are also working on an option to accept smaller donations as well. And if none of that is possible, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/midcamp-2018-midwest-drupal-camp-chicago-illinois-tickets-41173372666">registering</a> or <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/article/call-volunteers">volunteering</a> helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do what you can, and hopefully we can all make it happen. Looking forward to seeing everyone in Chicago in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Update: MidCamp is also accepting donations of any size</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really appreciate the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/drupal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#drupal</a> community love and support for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MidCamp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MidCamp</a>.
