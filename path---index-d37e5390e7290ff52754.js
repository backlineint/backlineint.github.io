Possibly just one of my favorite <em>things</em> of all time. I don't like U2 all that much, yet somehow hearing Scott and Scott break down U2's entire discography over 24 episodes was something I saved for special occasions and often laughed to the point of tears while listening to. And boy, did they ever spend a lot of time talking about the band U2 (not really.)  They even knew the names of every single member of the band. Truly encyclopedic knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now Scott and Scott are back with '<a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/show/u-talkin-u2-to-me/\">R U Talkin' R.E.M. RE: ME?</a>' in which they explore the output of the band R.E.M in what I'm sure will be painstaking detail. I like R.E.M. more than I like U2, but I can't say I would ever want to go through their entire back catalog. Yet somehow here we are again, and I'm excited to hear all about the album Monster.

We lose a bit of the protection that Drupal provided us from something like malformed markup in a body field making a page explode.

The main reason that I don't like the term is because I feel like it doesn't mean that much to people. \r\n Full stack developer kind of feels like someone saying 'I'll do whatever'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm not sure if it is directly related to being a full stack developer, but over the years I've seen a pattern in how I'm utilized. In my various roles as a developer, I often start out doing front end work, and then over time find myself doing predominantly back end work. This could be because back end work has a higher value at the places I've worked.  It also could be because I suck at front end and just don't know it (hopefully not that one.) It's almost as if what people take full stack to mean is that the developer is exaggerating about their skill level on either the front or back end of the stack. Or maybe that they just haven't figured out which end of the stack their real talent lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've always considered myself someone who prefers front end, so that is a bit of a challenging pattern to be stuck in. But lately I've been wondering, am I not being honest with myself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I'm just describing myself wrong. I often describe myself as is a full stack developer with a preference for front end.  While that sounds kind of like a line from a personal ad, it does describe what I like to work on. I prefer front end work, can do back end work, and especially enjoy back end work  when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drilling down on that last part brings us to the section where perhaps I'm not being honest with myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I can do back end work, and especially enjoy it when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe my real thing is what lies in the middle.

Having a project I could slowly chip away at over the year provided a great low pressure way to learn, and also prevented me from having to re-learn things as they vanished from my brain.

I like what I\'ve seen of Gatsby thus far. It allows me to leverage all of the things I\'ve enjoyed about React, while combining that with the features of a static site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. And it plays nice with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/8">Drupal 8</a> as well, which is a plus.</p>\r\n<p>So welcome to my new Gatsby site. It will be nice to have an active personal website again, but perhaps even more exciting is the fact that this serves as another low pressure project I can chip away at throughout 2018 to learn more about React and decoupling Drupal. I\'ll start out with a site very close to nothing - little content, little styling - and slowly add new stuff as time and interest allows.</p>\r\n<p>With any luck this site will look completely different by the time 2019 approaches.

After updating the post to add the missing quote and doing another build, everything was fine again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could chalk most of this up to me - if I was using a wysiwyg editor it would have added the correct link markup for me, and I should probably be taking a closer look at my build after it goes to GitHub Pages. But I think this hiccup was a nice reminder of the reality of these super sexy decoupled architectures. We lose a bit of the protection that Drupal provided us from something like malformed markup in a body field making a page explode.  Builds will break in ways that they didn\'t with Drupal alone - the site worked fine in development mode but broke when the production bundle was built. And while testing is always important, we likely need to test in ways that are different from when we were testing Drupal by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lessons to be learned even in the dumbest of problems. I\'m sure I\'ll run into some more.</p>'},fields:{slug:"/post/decoupled-drupal-dumb-problems:-malformed-markup/"},post_type:"post",created:1519140479}},{node:{id:"a78b147d-f5ac-41aa-a818-5e23b1855559",title:"Middle End Developer",body:{value:"<p>I say that I'm a 'full stack' developer, even though it is a term I've never really liked all that much.  The main reason that I don't like the term is because I feel like it doesn't mean that much to people. \r\n Full stack developer kind of feels like someone saying 'I'll do whatever'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm not sure if it is directly related to being a full stack developer, but over the years I've seen a pattern in how I'm utilized. In my various roles as a developer, I often start out doing front end work, and then over time find myself doing predominantly back end work. This could be because back end work has a higher value at the places I've worked.  It also could be because I suck at front end and just don't know it (hopefully not that one.) It's almost as if what people take full stack to mean is that the developer is exaggerating about their skill level on either the front or back end of the stack. Or maybe that they just haven't figured out which end of the stack their real talent lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've always considered myself someone who prefers front end, so that is a bit of a challenging pattern to be stuck in. But lately I've been wondering, am I not being honest with myself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I'm just describing myself wrong. I often describe myself as is a full stack developer with a preference for front end.  While that sounds kind of like a line from a personal ad, it does describe what I like to work on. I prefer front end work, can do back end work, and especially enjoy back end work  when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drilling down on that last part brings us to the section where perhaps I'm not being honest with myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I can do back end work, and especially enjoy it when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe my real thing is what lies in the middle.

Developing and maintaining pattern libraries. Helping different developers or different systems integrate with pattern libraries.

The process of putting together a session submission is always an interesting one for me. For DrupalCon it is usually a wonderful mix of overanalyzing, combined with good old fashioned imposter syndrome. That said, I feel like I improve each time around, and I think these are my strongest proposals yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission one was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">Component Based Theming with UI Patterns</a>.\' <a href="https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">I\'ve given this talk before</a> and was happy with how it turned out. I submitted this one very early, and also noticed that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mariohernandez">Mario Hernandez</a> had submitted <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/integrating-components-uipatterns">another talk on the topic as well</a>. In hindsight, I should have reached out to him and seen if there was any way to collaborate as he ended up joining up with another speaker for his session. Lesson learned for next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission two was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/hot-jamstack-lessons-learned-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Lessons from Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a>.\' Strong competition as well here with many Decoupled Drupal and React related topics, but Im hoping I have a slightly different angle that might garner some interest. True to my usual form, I also went with a goofy, high-concept approach with the submission. Almost got cold feet about going in that direction, but decided I\'d rather have fun with it. Ironically, with a proposal that heavily references music, I didn\'t even make the Music City connection until writing this post. Would have been fun to play that angle up more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be my third time submitting sessions to DrupalCon North America (which I guess is now just DrupalCon?) I\'ve never been selected, but I have been asked to be on call as a back up speaker, which I had no idea was even a thing. Regardless of the outcome, I enjoyed the process putting these session proposals together and look forward to Nashville this year. I\'ve never been!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Update: Was a little wrapped up in the DrupalCon deadline, but I also submitted both of these sessions to <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/">MidCamp</a> in Chicago.

Happy 2018!</p>\r\n<p>It could be another case of New Years delusion, but this year I think the timing might actually make sense. Over the past year I\'ve been exploring <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and the world of <a href="https://dri.es/how-to-decouple-drupal-in-2018">Decoupled Drupal</a>. After working through <a href="http://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>\' <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React For Beginners</a> course and having some concepts finally click, I took another shot at creating <a href="http://brianperryinteractive.com/aoty-visualizations/">a web app based on the Album of the Year Project</a>. Having a project I could slowly chip away at over the year provided a great low pressure way to learn, and also prevented me from having to re-learn things as they vanished from my brain. I\'d love to duplicate that situation in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Next up learning wise I\'m planning on continuing my experimentation with the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> by way of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a>. I like what I\'ve seen of Gatsby thus far. It allows me to leverage all of the things I\'ve enjoyed about React, while combining that with the features of a static site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. And it plays nice with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/8">Drupal 8</a> as well, which is a plus.</p>\r\n<p>So welcome to my new Gatsby site. It will be nice to have an active personal website again, but perhaps even more exciting is the fact that this serves as another low pressure project I can chip away at throughout 2018 to learn more about React and decoupling Drupal. I\'ll start out with a site very close to nothing - little content, little styling - and slowly add new stuff as time and interest allows.</p>\r\n<p>With any luck this site will look completely different by the time 2019 approaches. And hopefully I will have learned a thing or two along the way.
