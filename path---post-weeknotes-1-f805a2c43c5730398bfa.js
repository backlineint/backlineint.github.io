Lately it has been difficult finding the time to post on my website (I\'m hoping to rebuild it soon,) so this seems like a great way to keep something going in the meantime.<p>\r\n<p>Work Stuff:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Had meeting this week where we shared overviews of recent projects. Always inspiring and great to work with so many people doing cool things outside of the Drupal bubble that I sometimes live in.</li>\r\n<li>Been doing a lot of prep for <a href="http://midcamp.org">MidCamp</a>. I’ve been helping out with organizing the event, and I’m doing a <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/2019/training-proposal/google-analytics-and-google-tag-manager-101">training</a> along with <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/2019/topic-proposal/external-design-system-practice">two</a> <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/2019/topic-proposal/introduction-static-site-generators-drupalists-and-static-site-show-and-tell">sessions</a> (originally one, but I’m filing in for a cancellation.) It’s stressful, but I love the camp so I’m happy to endure the PowerPoint burnout. I’m excited for the talks, and it is been fun dusting off my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Unica_NetInsight">analytics hat</a> for the training.</li>\r\n<li>Project wise, I’ve been digging into <a href="https://docs.drupalcommerce.org/commerce2">Drupal Commerce</a> for the first time. Taking a bit to wrap my head around it, but I’m liking it thus far.</li>\r\n<li>Received some positive recognition at work for my efforts over the last year. Helps put some extra gas in the tank during what is going to be a busy couple of weeks.</li>\r\n<li>Got a nice shout of from Ryan at Hook 42 in their <a href="https://www.hook42.com/blog/florida-drupal-camp-sunglasses-alligators-community-and-connection">Florida Drupal Camp wrap up</a>.</li>\r\n<li>My office now has an Nintendo 64 with the original Smash Brothers. This is big news.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal Stuff:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Found out that Colin did really well on some advanced placement testing. He’ll destroy us all soon.</li>\r\n<li>I’m really itching for some warmer weather. Forced myself to run outside this weekend even though it was still a little cold - well worth it once I warmed up. Also really looking forward to getting back to outdoor barbecue.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Stuff I\'m Into:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enjoying <a href="https://hollowknight.com/">Hollow Knight</a> on Switch along with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tetris-99-switch">Tetris 99</a> (Switch) and <a href="https://www.tetriseffect.game/">Tetris Effect</a> (PS4). Who knew I’d be so into Tetris in 2019?</li>\r\n<li>To say I’m ‘into it’ is a stretch, but I’m still reeling from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/comedians-remember-brody-stevens.html">Brody Steven’s passing</a>. Listened to a nice tribute on <a href="https://www.earwolf.com/episode/remembering-brody-stevens/">Who Charted</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Into the extremely thoughtful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/still-processing-podcast">Still Processing Podcast</a> including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/podcasts/still-processing-mj-michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html">their M.J. episode</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Beer: <a href="https://www.3floyds.com/beer/lord-rear-admiral/">3 Floyds Lord Rear Admiral</a>. An ESB with 3 Floyd\'s signature blown out flavor profile.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I made it through my first weeknote!</p>\r\n\r\n'},relationships:{image:null},created:1552859717}},pathContext:{slug:"/post/weeknotes-1/"}}}});
