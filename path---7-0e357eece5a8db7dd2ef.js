More than any other technology I’ve touched over the last 10 years of my career, I just haven’t had it click for me. It’s very frustrating as I really want to learn it, and it’s clear the library has legs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I found React very difficult to learn the first time I attempted it. So much so that I actually just gave up and moved on to other things. Given that, I find Brad's honest take here extremely relatable (except for the part where Dan Abramov personally helped him through his React struggles.) And from a purely selfish perspective, knowing that a developer (sorry, frontend designer) that I admire had similar struggles with React makes me feel a bit better about myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still don't consider myself a React expert, but three specific things made it click for me:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I know Brad threw some shade in his post, but <a href=\"https://reactforbeginners.com/\">Wes Bos' React for Beginners</a> just made a lot of sense to me when other tutorials didn't.</li>\r\n<li>I enforced what I learned by applying it to <a href=\"https://github.com/backlineint/aoty-visualizations\">a side project that I found legitimately interesting</a>.</li>\r\n<li>I eventually realized that I was trying to tackle things that were too complex. It wasn't until I focused on nailing some really basic stuff that things started to move fast and click. For me it was representing data in a table before I started trying to filter, sort, or otherwise visualize that data. For Brad it was <a href=\"http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/dumb-react/\">rendering a full page worth of mock components</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm glad I pushed through.
