Didn\'t know that vertical mode was a thing? A small subset of often retro games support it. To try out the grip I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/arcade-archives-donkey-kong-switch">Arcade Archives: Donkey Kong</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/namco-museum-switch">Namco Museum</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pinball-fx3-switch">Pinball FX3</a>. All told, I spent much more on games than the $12 that the grip costs.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, it works extremely well for the games that support vertical mode. It isn\'t something that I\'ll use that often, but I love having yet another configuration of this versatile device. Fingers crossed that a version of Ms. Pac-Man that supports vertical mode is released at some point.</p>  '},relationships:{image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.0769230769230769,src:"/static/44f040f8156059abc476919c742536e9-bf6401f0813d015bfd98379261b3de56-42807.jpg",srcSet:"/static/44f040f8156059abc476919c742536e9-bf6401f0813d015bfd98379261b3de56-960f9.jpg 313w,\n/static/44f040f8156059abc476919c742536e9-bf6401f0813d015bfd98379261b3de56-c36f2.jpg 625w,\n/static/44f040f8156059abc476919c742536e9-bf6401f0813d015bfd98379261b3de56-42807.jpg 1250w,\n/static/44f040f8156059abc476919c742536e9-bf6401f0813d015bfd98379261b3de56-dbc5e.jpg 1875w,\n/static/44f040f8156059abc476919c742536e9-bf6401f0813d015bfd98379261b3de56-6e234.jpg 2500w,\n/static/44f040f8156059abc476919c742536e9-bf6401f0813d015bfd98379261b3de56-a7d90.jpg 3024w",sizes:"(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px"}}}}},fields:{slug:"/post/flip-grip-mini-review/"},post_type:"post",created:1544108145}},{node:{id:"e7f7525d-76fb-4ad7-8d88-41c9d66d19a4",title:"Talking Drupal #188 - Static Site Generation",link:"http://www.talkingdrupal.com/188",body:{value:'<p>Had a great time dropping in on the <a href="http://www.talkingdrupal.com/">Talking Drupal podcast</a> to talk about static site generation.

The quote above from a fantastic 1993 New Yorker profile kept rattling around in my head.
