I usually have a pretty good handle on what I want to accomplish in the upcoming year, along with a formal resolution. But this year, nothing. Initially that seemed terrifying, but the more I think about it, that openness and lack of expectation is an exciting resolution in and of itself.</p>\r\n<p>Standing in my now <em>mostly</em> finished kitchen I also came up with another late breaking resolution. 2019 is going to be the year of intentional home improvements. Rather than letting a flood force me into it, I'm going to try to proactively decorate, improve and declutter. It is pleasantly (mostly) non-technical, and I can tackle it in tiny chunks throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p>Wishing everyone a happy and productive 2019 full of dry kitchens.</p> "},relationships:{image:null},created:1546524528}},pathContext:{slug:"/post/intentional-home-improvements/"}}}});
