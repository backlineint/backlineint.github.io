I\'d really hate to see MidCamp have to scale back and not be the MidCamp we all know it can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways you can help. If you have a company (or a rich uncle) that could <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/become-a-sponsor">sponsor</a>, that could make a huge difference. If you have the means to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/midcamp-2018-midwest-drupal-camp-chicago-illinois-tickets-41173372666#tickets">become an individual sponsor</a>, that would help too. Word is that they are also working on an option to accept smaller donations as well. And if none of that is possible, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/midcamp-2018-midwest-drupal-camp-chicago-illinois-tickets-41173372666">registering</a> or <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/article/call-volunteers">volunteering</a> helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do what you can, and hopefully we can all make it happen.
