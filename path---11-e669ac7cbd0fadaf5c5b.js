It is also the first Drupal event I ever presented at, and <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/hot-jamstack-lessons-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">I\'m scheduled to speak again</a> this year. I\'d really hate to see MidCamp have to scale back and not be the MidCamp we all know it can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways you can help. If you have a company (or a rich uncle) that could <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/become-a-sponsor">sponsor</a>, that could make a huge difference. If you have the means to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/midcamp-2018-midwest-drupal-camp-chicago-illinois-tickets-41173372666#tickets">become an individual sponsor</a>, that would help too. Word is that they are also working on an option to accept smaller donations as well. And if none of that is possible, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/midcamp-2018-midwest-drupal-camp-chicago-illinois-tickets-41173372666">registering</a> or <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/article/call-volunteers">volunteering</a> helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do what you can, and hopefully we can all make it happen.

The process of putting together a session submission is always an interesting one for me. For DrupalCon it is usually a wonderful mix of overanalyzing, combined with good old fashioned imposter syndrome. That said, I feel like I improve each time around, and I think these are my strongest proposals yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission one was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">Component Based Theming with UI Patterns</a>.\' <a href="https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">I\'ve given this talk before</a> and was happy with how it turned out. I submitted this one very early, and also noticed that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mariohernandez">Mario Hernandez</a> had submitted <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/integrating-components-uipatterns">another talk on the topic as well</a>. In hindsight, I should have reached out to him and seen if there was any way to collaborate as he ended up joining up with another speaker for his session. Lesson learned for next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission two was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/hot-jamstack-lessons-learned-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Lessons from Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a>.\' Strong competition as well here with many Decoupled Drupal and React related topics, but Im hoping I have a slightly different angle that might garner some interest. True to my usual form, I also went with a goofy, high-concept approach with the submission. Almost got cold feet about going in that direction, but decided I\'d rather have fun with it. Ironically, with a proposal that heavily references music, I didn\'t even make the Music City connection until writing this post. Would have been fun to play that angle up more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be my third time submitting sessions to DrupalCon North America (which I guess is now just DrupalCon?) I\'ve never been selected, but I have been asked to be on call as a back up speaker, which I had no idea was even a thing. Regardless of the outcome, I enjoyed the process putting these session proposals together and look forward to Nashville this year. I\'ve never been!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Update: Was a little wrapped up in the DrupalCon deadline, but I also submitted both of these sessions to <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/">MidCamp</a> in Chicago. In addition to being my home camp, MidCamp is always really, really great. You should go!</p>'},relationships:{image:null},fields:{slug:"/post/drupalcon-nashville-session-proposals/"},post_type:"post",created:1517239500}}],pathPrefix:"",first:!1,last:!1,index:11,pageCount:12,additionalContext:{}}}}});
