If this happened to my home theater back in the <a href="http://improvboston.com">ImprovBoston</a> days, I probably would have reacted the exact same way. Running a theater is an inherently risky business and 25 years is quite an accomplishment. I hope everyone finds a new home to keep doing what they love.</p>'},created:1518665977}},pathContext:{slug:"/link/io-west-is-shutting-down-next-week-splitsider/"}}}});
