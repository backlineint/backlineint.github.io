It was strange being back in the building at first, but once I set foot on stage it felt as if no time had passed at all. And I even had an opportunity to publicly shame my brother for his eating habits, which makes the night a success by any measure.</p> \r\n<p>Thanks to all who took in this over the top show, avoided my flailing limbs when I repeatedly climbed over audience chairs, and humored a now dad-heavy group of improvisers as they gave comedy one more spin. Being able to see so many great friends that I hadn't seen in years makes getting stuck on the red line for an hour more than worth it.</p>\r\n<p>The show was such a success that I'll once again be retiring from improv effective immediately. I'll see you all at the 20 year reunion.</p>\r\n<p>(Photo via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/haroldnight\">@haroldnight</a>.
