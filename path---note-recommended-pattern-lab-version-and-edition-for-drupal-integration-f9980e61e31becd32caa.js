Most if not all of the changes from the fork have been merged back into the main Pattern Lab repository.</li>\r\n<li>And regarding the edition, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/evanlovely">EvanLovely</a> somewhat surprisingly recommends the Twig edition over the Drupal edition. Apparently the differences are minimal, and "A true Drupal edition is better represented as a Drupal theme with the Twig edition integrated."</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So in summary, the next time you need Pattern Lab for a Drupal project, <a href="https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-twig-standard">go here</a>.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Helpful clarification given all of the Pattern Lab forks and editions floating around out there.</p>'},relationships:{image:null},created:1525878159}},pathContext:{slug:"/note/recommended-pattern-lab-version-and-edition-for-drupal-integration/"}}}});
