title: Fun With Jekyll
---

Thus far this site functions as both an attempt to update my personal site, and an attempt to experiment with Jekyll. I have quite a bit more to do on the content side, but I've definitely enjoyed using Jekyll so far.  Since I'm going to be the only one managing content, and I enjoy working in code, having a full blown 'traditional' CMS could be overkill in this case.  Plus I get easy hosting on Github Pages and also get to opt out of the traditional cycle of CMS security updates. Looking forward to learning more as I build out the rest of this site.
