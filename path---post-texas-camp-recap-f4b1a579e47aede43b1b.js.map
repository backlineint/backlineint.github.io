It was an extremely well organized event attended by a bunch of super engaged and friendly Drupalers. A bit of a short trip for me as I had tickets to see <a href=\\\"https://www.hdtgminfo.com/\\\">How Did This Get Made</a> back home on Saturday night, but that just resulted in things being focused around a couple of clear themes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Visual Regression Testing</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Visual Regression Testing is a topic I’ve been interested in quite a while now, but I’ve fallen out of practice as of late. I was really excited to see that there was a bunch of content on visual regression testing planned for the camp, much of which was focused around <a href=\\\"https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/\\\">BackstopJS</a>. I’ve tried a number of other solutions in the past (<a href=\\\"https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith\\\">Wraith</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS\\\">PhantomCSS</a>, <a href=\\\"http://webdriver.io/\\\">WebDriverIO</a>) but not Backstop JS which seems to be gaining momentum in the Drupal community.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On Thursday the folks at <a href=\\\"http://pantheon.io/\\\">Pantheon</a> held a training session on BackstopJS, which I attended.  It provided a great overview of how they use the tool, along with some example repositories for learning. By the end of the training I had completed a first pass at adding a suite of regression tests to this blog. I would have liked to see a little more content in the training about the general functionality of BackstopJS rather than the Pantheon team’s use cases, but any training where I can walk out with a real world example implemented is a big win.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Continuing on the Backstop train I also doubled down and attended <a href=\\\"https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/deploy-without-fear--visual-regression-testing-with-backstopjs-is-here\\\">Ryan Bateman from Hook 42’s session on BackstopJS</a>. He provided a little more of the general functional overview that I was looking for after the training, and also talked about the <a href=\\\"https://www.drupal.org/project/backstop_generator\\\">Backstop Generator</a> module that he had recently created. Backstop generator allows you to quickly create a backstop.json file that tests against specific pages on your site and/or a random selection of pages. Seems like a great way for Drupal projects to take advantage of BackstopJS with very little effort. It was also great getting a chance to talk with Ryan later on in the camp - I think he stands as the only Alaskan Drupalist I’ve ever met.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Due to travel I wasn’t able to catch David Stinemetze from Rackspace’s related <a href=\\\"https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/archiving-and-visual-regression-using-drupal-8\\\">Archiving and Visual Regression Using Drupal 8</a> session, but I’m planning on catching up on the video later.<p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Community</b></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Texas Camp featured two very excellent keynotes that I was lucky enough to enjoy over breakfast burritos.
