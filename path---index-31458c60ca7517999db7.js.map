Thankfully the only rule about this weeknotes thing is that there are no rules.</p>\\r\\n<p>MidCamp:</p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.midcamp.org/\\\">MidCamp</a> (the Midwest Drupal Camp) resulted in a week that was both all consuming and extremely gratifying.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>On Wednesday I led a <a href=\\\"https://www.midcamp.org/2019/training-proposal/google-analytics-and-google-tag-manager-101\\\">Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager training session</a> along with the one and only <a href=\\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonmeck/\\\">Jon Meck</a>. It was my first time co-leading a training session at a Drupal event and even though I was one of the trainers I learned a ton.</li>\\r\\n<li>On Thursday I presented '<a href=\\\"https://noti.st/brianperry/5uL8Bn/an-external-design-system-in-practice\\\">An External Design System in Practice</a>' for the first time. Got some great feedback and am excited to make a few tweaks before <a href=\\\"https://events.drupal.org/seattle2019/sessions/external-design-system-practice\\\">presenting it again at DrupalCon</a>.</li>\\r\\n<li>On Friday I presented '<a href=\\\"https://noti.st/brianperry/82jab2/an-introduction-to-static-site-generators-for-drupalists\\\">An Introduction to Static Site Generators for Drupalists</a>.' Enjoyed giving this talk as always and had time for a lengthy Q&A this time around.</li>\\r\\n<li>I used <a href=\\\"https://noti.st/\\\">Notist for the first time to share content related to my talks. I like it quite a bit.</li>\\r\\n<li>Loved so many other talks, but especially <a href=\\\"https://www.midcamp.org/2019/topic-proposal/keynote-session-actions-speak-louder-code\\\">Actions Speak Louder Than Code</a> (so happy that Fatima gave her first keynote at MidCamp,) <a href=\\\"https://www.midcamp.org/2019/topic-proposal/you-are-here-exploring-most-magical-cms-earth\\\">You are Here: Exploring the Most Magical CMS on Earth</a> (worth it for one Drupal as Disney slide alone) and <a href=\\\"https://www.midcamp.org/2019/topic-proposal/bash-magic-no-its-not\\\">Bash is Magic # No It's Not</a> (Dwayne was incredibly passionate about this topic which made it a joy to watch.)</li>\\r\\n<li>Had a productive contribution day getting to know more about the <a href=\\\"https://www.drupal.org/project/claro\\\">Claro theme</a> and even got a patch updated. Heard great things about the efforts around Drupal 9 readiness as well.</li>\\r\\n<li>This was my first year involved as an organizer. I feel good about the execution of the camp and my role in it. And I'm really just happy to work with such a great group to support an event that has meant a lot to me over the years.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Everything Else:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Went right from MidCamp to spend the rest of the weekend (plus Monday) with family in Wisconsin. A much needed break.</li>\\r\\n<li>Loved <a href=\\\"https://tv.avclub.com/a-familiar-bobs-burgers-cant-rule-out-bob-being-a-bread-1833196922\\\">this Episode of Bob's Burgers</a></li>\\r\\n<li>Colin and I finished the <a href=\\\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/05/what-ive-learned-about-the-nintendo-labo-piano.html\\\">Nintendo Labo Piano</a>, which was a personal triumph.
