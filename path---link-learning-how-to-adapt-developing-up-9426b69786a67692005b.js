We end up pretty far away from some of the traditional dev topics you might expect, but I think that is the improviser in me applying  \'yes, and...\' to our conversation. Mike does a great job reinforcing how some of my more tangential thoughts relate back to adaptability. Not to mention some great editing - you can hardly tell that we were talking at the end of a long day at a conference.</p>'},relationships:{image:null},created:1536711066}},pathContext:{slug:"/link/learning-how-to-adapt-developing-up/"}}}});
