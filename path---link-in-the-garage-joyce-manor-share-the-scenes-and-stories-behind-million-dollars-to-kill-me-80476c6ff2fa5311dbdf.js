And he’s like no, no, no,” handing the band $100 out of his pocket.</blockquote>\r\n<p>Great profile in general, but this moment between two of my favorite bands stuck with me.

And I love that this impulsive moment also sticks with Joyce Manor eight years later as co-headliners. While I've never just handed someone $100, I can only hope that back in my improv days or now in the open source community I've had some small moments that have stuck with folks.</p>"},relationships:{image:null},created:1535467148}},pathContext:{slug:"/link/in-the-garage:-joyce-manor-share-the-scenes-and-stories-behind-million-dollars-to-kill-me/"}}}});
