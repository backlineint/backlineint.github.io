The highest priority projects that I needed to apply the security release to were on 8.4.5 at the time of the pre-announcement. I took this as a good opportunity to upgrade to 8.5 and then kind of got tunnel vision about getting these projects, and also my lower priority D8 projects up to 8.5 in preparation for the security release. Not having looked back at the security advisory since my initial read, I lost sight of the fact that I could easily apply the patch to their current D8 version and worry about 8.5 when the pressure was off a little bit.  Thankfully I was reminded of this during a well timed check in meeting with the Drupal practice at HS2 - a few of my 8.5 upgrades were a little behind schedule.  Having the flexibility to apply the security update to older versions of D8 really helped and most likely prevented us from rushing a few upgrade related regressions out into production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the 8.5 upgrade getting a bit behind schedule, minor Drupal updates (8.4, 8.5 and so on) are still more challenging than I\'d expect them to be.  Jeff Geerling\'s post <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Updating drupal/core with Composer - but Drupal core doesn\'t update</a> proved invaluable as I ran into the same issue. I also had another pretty tricky dependency conflict that eventually required me to remove and work around a dependency (again, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Jeff Geerling\'s post</a> helped quite a bit here.)  After successfully upgrading to 8.5 composer-wise, I found that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/page_manager/issues/2918564">a patch to Page Manager</a> needed to be applied for the site to even run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m getting better with managing Drupal projects via composer, but still have some room to grow.  Lowest hanging fruit is that I need to start managing patches via composer. Once that clicked in my brain it was a little to late to experiment with it.  Next time.  I also still sometimes get tripped up with the difference between the ^ and ~ version constraints in composer.json which is embarrassing to admit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also ran updates on Drupal instances based on API-first distributions. Those were a bit of a different beast. In my case, most were single purpose enough that I was able to just run composer update and call it a day.  That said, each distro had their quirks.  The version of <a href="https://github.com/acquia/reservoir">Reservoir</a> I was using had a dependency conflict that prevented the upgrade until I manually locked Reservoir at Alpha 4. <a href="http://www.contentacms.org/">Contenta</a> seems to have <a href="https://github.com/contentacms/contenta_jsonapi/issues/266">a patch that won\'t apply to 8.5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m all for learning, but also looking forward to this process becoming smoother sailing in the future.</p>'},fields:{slug:"/note/drupal-8.5-and-security-updates/"},post_type:"note",created:1522418446}},{node:{id:"a96b9bb8-3afc-4fc8-9491-d3a4b62b85ea",title:"Shop Talk Show 303: JAM Stack with Phil Hawksworth",link:"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/303-jam-stack-phil-hawksworth/",body:{value:"<p>A great listen that could serve as a solid introduction to the JAM Stack concept.

A Drupal Crash Course for Non-Developers.</a>’ While it\'s easy to get wrapped up in the new and advanced at a camp like this, it is also really important to see newcomers, beginners, and people with Drupal-adjacent roles take steps into becoming more hands on with the CMS. She specifically mentioned that the training helped her have some revelations about a few Drupal-isms that us crazy developers have been talking about all this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some really enjoyable traffic, Friday brought me to the first day of sessions.  A couple of highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/local-dev-environments-dummies">Local Dev Environments for Dummies</a> - the bulk of this presentation reviewed data from a 2018 Drupal Developer Survey, and the data alone was extremely fascinating. It also provided some interesting perspectives on Vagrant vs. Docker for local development (go Vagrant if matching your prod environment exactly is important, and Docker for pretty much everything else.) I also walked out of this one itching to learn more about <a href="https://docs.devwithlando.io/">Lando</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/decoupled-drupal-across-stack">Decoupled Drupal Across The Stack</a> - always enjoy seeing <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/prestonso">Preston</a> speak about Decoupled Drupal, and being aware of his (and Acquia’s) perspective on the topic is important if I’m going to be speaking about adjacent topics as well. A good talk for  someone looking to survey the current Decoupled Drupal landscape. Was interesting to see that all of the examples Preston provided included some server side universal JavaScript component to handle the initial page view. I’ve been working on learning more about the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM Stack</a> which specifically does not include JavaScript running on the server. Seeing examples of this alternative stack helped get me thinking more about the pros and cons of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/component-based-drupal">Component Based Drupal</a> - Surprise! After a cancellation, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/nerdstein">Adam Bergstein</a> and I stepped in without much of a safety net (I learned that I was co-presenting this session due to <a href="https://twitter.com/hook42inc/status/971837614004342784">a mention on twitter</a>) to talk about the current state of building and theming with components in Drupal. I’ve always enjoyed my conversations with Adam on this topic because while we primarily agree, we also have some differences of opinion and take some different approaches in our workflow. Continuing this conversation out in the open seemed to be useful to people, and I even got to joke around a little bit. I wouldn’t be surprised if Adam and I presented in a similar format in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUAVgejng9w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday - less traffic, more sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/oop-pokemon-journey">OOP - The Pokemon Journey</a> / <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/bending-behats-benefits-live-coding-adventure">Bending Behat\'s Benefits: A live coding adventure</a> - A journey followed by an adventure?

After updating the post to add the missing quote and doing another build, everything was fine again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could chalk most of this up to me - if I was using a wysiwyg editor it would have added the correct link markup for me, and I should probably be taking a closer look at my build after it goes to GitHub Pages. But I think this hiccup was a nice reminder of the reality of these super sexy decoupled architectures. We lose a bit of the protection that Drupal provided us from something like malformed markup in a body field making a page explode.  Builds will break in ways that they didn\'t with Drupal alone - the site worked fine in development mode but broke when the production bundle was built. And while testing is always important, we likely need to test in ways that are different from when we were testing Drupal by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lessons to be learned even in the dumbest of problems.

In my various roles as a developer, I often start out doing front end work, and then over time find myself doing predominantly back end work. This could be because back end work has a higher value at the places I've worked.  It also could be because I suck at front end and just don't know it (hopefully not that one.)

True to my usual form, I also went with a goofy, high-concept approach with the submission. Almost got cold feet about going in that direction, but decided I\'d rather have fun with it. Ironically, with a proposal that heavily references music, I didn\'t even make the Music City connection until writing this post.

Over the past year I\'ve been exploring <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and the world of <a href="https://dri.es/how-to-decouple-drupal-in-2018">Decoupled Drupal</a>. After working through <a href="http://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>\' <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React For Beginners</a> course and having some concepts finally click, I took another shot at creating <a href="http://brianperryinteractive.com/aoty-visualizations/">a web app based on the Album of the Year Project</a>. Having a project I could slowly chip away at over the year provided a great low pressure way to learn, and also prevented me from having to re-learn things as they vanished from my brain. I\'d love to duplicate that situation in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Next up learning wise I\'m planning on continuing my experimentation with the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> by way of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a>. I like what I\'ve seen of Gatsby thus far. It allows me to leverage all of the things I\'ve enjoyed about React, while combining that with the features of a static site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. And it plays nice with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/8">Drupal 8</a> as well, which is a plus.</p>\r\n<p>So welcome to my new Gatsby site. It will be nice to have an active personal website again, but perhaps even more exciting is the fact that this serves as another low pressure project I can chip away at throughout 2018 to learn more about React and decoupling Drupal. I\'ll start out with a site very close to nothing - little content, little styling - and slowly add new stuff as time and interest allows.</p>\r\n<p>With any luck this site will look completely different by the time 2019 approaches.

A couple of highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/local-dev-environments-dummies">Local Dev Environments for Dummies</a> - the bulk of this presentation reviewed data from a 2018 Drupal Developer Survey, and the data alone was extremely fascinating. It also provided some interesting perspectives on Vagrant vs. Docker for local development (go Vagrant if matching your prod environment exactly is important, and Docker for pretty much everything else.) I also walked out of this one itching to learn more about <a href="https://docs.devwithlando.io/">Lando</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/decoupled-drupal-across-stack">Decoupled Drupal Across The Stack</a> - always enjoy seeing <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/prestonso">Preston</a> speak about Decoupled Drupal, and being aware of his (and Acquia’s) perspective on the topic is important if I’m going to be speaking about adjacent topics as well. A good talk for  someone looking to survey the current Decoupled Drupal landscape. Was interesting to see that all of the examples Preston provided included some server side universal JavaScript component to handle the initial page view. I’ve been working on learning more about the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM Stack</a> which specifically does not include JavaScript running on the server. Seeing examples of this alternative stack helped get me thinking more about the pros and cons of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/component-based-drupal">Component Based Drupal</a> - Surprise! After a cancellation, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/nerdstein">Adam Bergstein</a> and I stepped in without much of a safety net (I learned that I was co-presenting this session due to <a href="https://twitter.com/hook42inc/status/971837614004342784">a mention on twitter</a>) to talk about the current state of building and theming with components in Drupal. I’ve always enjoyed my conversations with Adam on this topic because while we primarily agree, we also have some differences of opinion and take some different approaches in our workflow. Continuing this conversation out in the open seemed to be useful to people, and I even got to joke around a little bit. I wouldn’t be surprised if Adam and I presented in a similar format in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUAVgejng9w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday - less traffic, more sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/oop-pokemon-journey">OOP - The Pokemon Journey</a> / <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/bending-behats-benefits-live-coding-adventure">Bending Behat\'s Benefits: A live coding adventure</a> - A journey followed by an adventure?

I tried a new Gatsby build and saw the same thing. Next, I zeroed in on the post where content started overlapping and eventually noticed that I had some malformed markup in my post in Drupal - a missing closing quote for a href attribute. After updating the post to add the missing quote and doing another build, everything was fine again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could chalk most of this up to me - if I was using a wysiwyg editor it would have added the correct link markup for me, and I should probably be taking a closer look at my build after it goes to GitHub Pages. But I think this hiccup was a nice reminder of the reality of these super sexy decoupled architectures. We lose a bit of the protection that Drupal provided us from something like malformed markup in a body field making a page explode.  Builds will break in ways that they didn\'t with Drupal alone - the site worked fine in development mode but broke when the production bundle was built. And while testing is always important, we likely need to test in ways that are different from when we were testing Drupal by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lessons to be learned even in the dumbest of problems.

The main reason that I don't like the term is because I feel like it doesn't mean that much to people. \r\n Full stack developer kind of feels like someone saying 'I'll do whatever'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm not sure if it is directly related to being a full stack developer, but over the years I've seen a pattern in how I'm utilized. In my various roles as a developer, I often start out doing front end work, and then over time find myself doing predominantly back end work. This could be because back end work has a higher value at the places I've worked.  It also could be because I suck at front end and just don't know it (hopefully not that one.) It's almost as if what people take full stack to mean is that the developer is exaggerating about their skill level on either the front or back end of the stack. Or maybe that they just haven't figured out which end of the stack their real talent lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've always considered myself someone who prefers front end, so that is a bit of a challenging pattern to be stuck in. But lately I've been wondering, am I not being honest with myself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I'm just describing myself wrong. I often describe myself as is a full stack developer with a preference for front end.  While that sounds kind of like a line from a personal ad, it does describe what I like to work on. I prefer front end work, can do back end work, and especially enjoy back end work  when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drilling down on that last part brings us to the section where perhaps I'm not being honest with myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I can do back end work, and especially enjoy it when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe my real thing is what lies in the middle.

The process of putting together a session submission is always an interesting one for me. For DrupalCon it is usually a wonderful mix of overanalyzing, combined with good old fashioned imposter syndrome. That said, I feel like I improve each time around, and I think these are my strongest proposals yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission one was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">Component Based Theming with UI Patterns</a>.\' <a href="https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">I\'ve given this talk before</a> and was happy with how it turned out.

In hindsight, I should have reached out to him and seen if there was any way to collaborate as he ended up joining up with another speaker for his session. Lesson learned for next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission two was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/hot-jamstack-lessons-learned-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Lessons from Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a>.\' Strong competition as well here with many Decoupled Drupal and React related topics, but Im hoping I have a slightly different angle that might garner some interest. True to my usual form, I also went with a goofy, high-concept approach with the submission. Almost got cold feet about going in that direction, but decided I\'d rather have fun with it. Ironically, with a proposal that heavily references music, I didn\'t even make the Music City connection until writing this post. Would have been fun to play that angle up more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be my third time submitting sessions to DrupalCon North America (which I guess is now just DrupalCon?)

Happy 2018!</p>\r\n<p>It could be another case of New Years delusion, but this year I think the timing might actually make sense. Over the past year I\'ve been exploring <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and the world of <a href="https://dri.es/how-to-decouple-drupal-in-2018">Decoupled Drupal</a>. After working through <a href="http://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>\' <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React For Beginners</a> course and having some concepts finally click, I took another shot at creating <a href="http://brianperryinteractive.com/aoty-visualizations/">a web app based on the Album of the Year Project</a>. Having a project I could slowly chip away at over the year provided a great low pressure way to learn, and also prevented me from having to re-learn things as they vanished from my brain. I\'d love to duplicate that situation in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Next up learning wise I\'m planning on continuing my experimentation with the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> by way of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a>. I like what I\'ve seen of Gatsby thus far. It allows me to leverage all of the things I\'ve enjoyed about React, while combining that with the features of a static site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. And it plays nice with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/8">Drupal 8</a> as well, which is a plus.</p>\r\n<p>So welcome to my new Gatsby site. It will be nice to have an active personal website again, but perhaps even more exciting is the fact that this serves as another low pressure project I can chip away at throughout 2018 to learn more about React and decoupling Drupal. I\'ll start out with a site very close to nothing - little content, little styling - and slowly add new stuff as time and interest allows.</p>\r\n<p>With any luck this site will look completely different by the time 2019 approaches.

The highest priority projects that I needed to apply the security release to were on 8.4.5 at the time of the pre-announcement. I took this as a good opportunity to upgrade to 8.5 and then kind of got tunnel vision about getting these projects, and also my lower priority D8 projects up to 8.5 in preparation for the security release. Not having looked back at the security advisory since my initial read, I lost sight of the fact that I could easily apply the patch to their current D8 version and worry about 8.5 when the pressure was off a little bit.  Thankfully I was reminded of this during a well timed check in meeting with the Drupal practice at HS2 - a few of my 8.5 upgrades were a little behind schedule.  Having the flexibility to apply the security update to older versions of D8 really helped and most likely prevented us from rushing a few upgrade related regressions out into production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the 8.5 upgrade getting a bit behind schedule, minor Drupal updates (8.4, 8.5 and so on) are still more challenging than I\'d expect them to be.  Jeff Geerling\'s post <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Updating drupal/core with Composer - but Drupal core doesn\'t update</a> proved invaluable as I ran into the same issue. I also had another pretty tricky dependency conflict that eventually required me to remove and work around a dependency (again, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Jeff Geerling\'s post</a> helped quite a bit here.)  After successfully upgrading to 8.5 composer-wise, I found that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/page_manager/issues/2918564">a patch to Page Manager</a> needed to be applied for the site to even run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m getting better with managing Drupal projects via composer, but still have some room to grow.

Those were a bit of a different beast. In my case, most were single purpose enough that I was able to just run composer update and call it a day.  That said, each distro had their quirks.
