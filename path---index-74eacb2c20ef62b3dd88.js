I wanted to move the blog to Gatsby and also take better advantage of the campperry.fun domain than I could on my current Github Pages configuration. Seemed like as good an excuse as any to try out Netlify. After granting access to my github repo, Netlify was able to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Automatically determine that I had a Gatsby site, and configure the build process accordingly</li>\r\n<li>Deploy a new build whenever a commit was made to the master branch</li>\r\n<li>For each new pull request, create a deploy preview site that I could use to sanity check my changes</li>\r\n<li>Use my custom domain (this took a little configuration and was the hardest part, but mainly because I'm not great at domain stuff)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All of that in a few minutes, and on the free tier. They also offer one click https, which I haven't gotten around to yet. Well worth checking out if you're looking for a place to host a static site build.

It was an extremely well organized event attended by a bunch of super engaged and friendly Drupalers. A bit of a short trip for me as I had tickets to see <a href="https://www.hdtgminfo.com/">How Did This Get Made</a> back home on Saturday night, but that just resulted in things being focused around a couple of clear themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Visual Regression Testing</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visual Regression Testing is a topic I’ve been interested in quite a while now, but I’ve fallen out of practice as of late. I was really excited to see that there was a bunch of content on visual regression testing planned for the camp, much of which was focused around <a href="https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/">BackstopJS</a>. I’ve tried a number of other solutions in the past (<a href="https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith">Wraith</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS">PhantomCSS</a>, <a href="http://webdriver.io/">WebDriverIO</a>) but not Backstop JS which seems to be gaining momentum in the Drupal community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday the folks at <a href="http://pantheon.io/">Pantheon</a> held a training session on BackstopJS, which I attended.  It provided a great overview of how they use the tool, along with some example repositories for learning. By the end of the training I had completed a first pass at adding a suite of regression tests to this blog. I would have liked to see a little more content in the training about the general functionality of BackstopJS rather than the Pantheon team’s use cases, but any training where I can walk out with a real world example implemented is a big win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing on the Backstop train I also doubled down and attended <a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/deploy-without-fear--visual-regression-testing-with-backstopjs-is-here">Ryan Bateman from Hook 42’s session on BackstopJS</a>. He provided a little more of the general functional overview that I was looking for after the training, and also talked about the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/backstop_generator">Backstop Generator</a> module that he had recently created. Backstop generator allows you to quickly create a backstop.json file that tests against specific pages on your site and/or a random selection of pages. Seems like a great way for Drupal projects to take advantage of BackstopJS with very little effort. It was also great getting a chance to talk with Ryan later on in the camp - I think he stands as the only Alaskan Drupalist I’ve ever met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to travel I wasn’t able to catch David Stinemetze from Rackspace’s related <a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/archiving-and-visual-regression-using-drupal-8">Archiving and Visual Regression Using Drupal 8</a> session, but I’m planning on catching up on the video later.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Community</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas Camp featured two very excellent keynotes that I was lucky enough to enjoy over breakfast burritos. Both are very much worth watching, so rather than try to recap, I’ll just paraphrase a few things that really stuck with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikki Stevens - <a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/happenings/keynote-breaking-the-binary-the-politics-of-code-and-inclusivity-in-technology">Breaking the Binary: The Politics of Code and Inclusivity in Technology</a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Diversity is being invited to the party.

As a result I got to give two talks in a single afternoon. This is fine for me because I love hearing myself talk, but to the brave souls who attended both of my sessions - I salute you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/component-based-theming-with-ui-patterns">Component Based Theming With UI Patterns</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXt3v3FSxss?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>Was exceptionally happy with the lively Q&A that followed the session.  Even if you\'ve heard me give this talk before, I\'d encourage you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXt3v3FSxss&feature=youtu.be&t=42m42s">jump to the Q&A at the end</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/hot-jamstack-building-a-music-discovery-app-with-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzDs3hGx3zY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>It was fun revisiting this talk after DrupalCon, but I was especially excited to hear from people who either have, or were planning to use the examples in this project to learn more about decoupled Drupal and React. That was main motivation behind the talk in the first place, so I\'m extremely happy that this project may have helped a few people find a starting point to experiment with decoupled Drupal and React.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Other Sessions</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also caught a handful of other great talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/web-accessibility-tips-and-tools">Web Accessibility Tips and Tools</a> - provided an excellent overview of a11y resources, many of which are <a href="http://bit.ly/2swdwj4">outlined in this google doc</a>.</li>\r\n<li><a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/manifestodriven-development">Manifesto-Driven Development</a> - an interesting look at influential tech manifestos and how you could use one to define the direction of a project.

And then Saturday night I met up with some old Boston friends and did the tourist-y <a href="http://www.batsinaustin.com/">bat bridge thing</a>, saw a fun band called <a href="http://www.quietcompanymusic.com/">Quiet Company</a> play at Stubbs BBQ, and closed out the night with some Austin food trucks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, a great trip.

I’m looking to test it with a variety of Pattern Lab instances - <a href-"https://github.com/backlineint/ui_patterns_pattern_lab/issues/2">can you help</a>?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we’ve run into each other at Drupal camps over the past couple of years, you’ve probably heard me talk about component based development and most likely also the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns">UI Patterns Module</a>. I’m a big supporter of a pattern library driven approach to building a Drupal site, but also feel that some common practices can be complicated - especially for those new to the approach or those not focused on the front end. In my opinion, UI Patterns can reduce that complexity quite a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the UI Patterns module came along it seemed too good to be true. It allowed patterns to be formally defined as Drupal plugins and took the data mapping that was commonly happening behind the scenes in Twig templates and exposed these in the admin UI where a wider audience could configure and understand them.  But if you were using an external pattern library in your project, configuring these patterns for use with the UI Patterns module felt a little redundant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a> for example you would commonly have a json or yaml file that specified sample data for each of the fields in your pattern. Much of that same data would be once again defined in the yaml file for the related UI Pattern in Drupal. The UI Patterns project has always envisioned that there would eventually be supporting modules that could automatically discover patterns from pattern libraries like Pattern Lab and Fractal, which would make it unnecessary to re-define patterns for use with Drupal. The module even contains classes that could be extended for this purpose. But similar to my initial feelings about the module, that just sounded too good to be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I should have seen this coming, but it might not be too good to be true after all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On an issue in the UI Patterns repository, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/pdureau">Pierre Dureau</a> shared his work creating such an integration module for use with UI Patterns and Fractal. It made a lot of sense to me when I looked at the code, and seemed like something that would be reasonable to adapt to a Pattern Lab version. I asked around to see if folks would be cool with me taking a shot at that, and the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_pattern_lab">UI Patterns Pattern Lab module</a> was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs of now, UI Patterns Pattern Lab supports the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Discovering UI Patterns that exist in the templates directory in any module or theme, or any custom twig namespace defined in a theme. Discovered patterns must have a pattern definition file in json or yaml, and a related twig template.</li>\r\n<li>Creating a library that includes css or js assets associated with your pattern.</li>\r\n<li>Parsing documentation from a related pattern documentation markdown file.</li>\r\n<li>Overriding default discovery behavior via variables in the pattern definition file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More detailed documentation is available in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/ui-patterns-pattern-lab">the documentation guide on Drupal.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the call for help part…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that the more Pattern Lab instances we can test this against, the more useful it can be (I did some initial testing using Emulsify and was able to fix a handful of bugs as a result.) If you have a Pattern Lab instance that you’d be willing to try with the module (or even just one you’d be willing to share with me), it would be a huge help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a wide variety of ways to configure patterns in Pattern Lab, so don’t be surprised if your pattern library is the one that causes the module to blow up. Also, the thing I’m struggling with right now is how realistic is is to use this with an existing pattern lab instance, especially ones that were set up to do a lot of complicated mapping in twig templates. It remains to be seen if the real use of this module would be with existing pattern lab instance, or along side a pattern library built with this approach in mind. Hopefully after putting this through the paces with a handful of Pattern Lab instances a trend will become obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d appreciate any of the help you or your pattern library can lend here.

Better get it in writing before the remaining echoes of country music drown it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My most important takeaway from my trip was that the Nashville Predators let fans smash a car painted with the opponents logo before games. Beyond that, I did also learn some things while at DrupalCon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>There is a lot of excitement behind Layout Builder and layout related initiatives</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the Layout Initiative was able to accomplish with the release of Layout Builder as an experimental module in Drupal 8.5 was extremely impressive.  It is a great foundation that the initiative already appears to have clear plans to flesh out and improve.  It was promising to see many well attended sessions on this topic, coverage in the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/driesnote">Driesnote</a>, and quite a bit of excitement about layouts and Layout Builder buzzing through the halls of Music City Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest gap I see in what exists thus far is the disconnect between the block based layout builder and the blocks UI. You currently have to leave the layout builder interface to create new custom blocks before you can add them to a layout, and these blocks have the potential to flood the main Drupal custom blocks UI.  I was very happy to hear that there is <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2948064">an issue related to inline creation of custom blocks</a> that should help bridge this gap. In a BOF on Components and The Layout Initiative <a href="http://bit.ly/components-layout">a number of other relevant issues were identified</a> that could potentially improve the experience and make Layout Builder play even more nicely with component based workflows. I’m hoping to follow along with these, go hands on frequently, and help out where I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Many are decoupling, but approaches vary</b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>To poorly paraphrase <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mrjmd">Matt Davis</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Many people build websites this way outside of the Drupal world, they just don’t call it decoupled</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a lot of great discussion at the Decoupled Summit (<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/decoupled-drupal-summit-at-drupalcon">Lullabot has a good recap</a>) but also a feeling that while decoupling continues to gain momentum in the Drupal community, there are still a wide variety of strategies and some alignment on best practices yet to come. That said, I think some of that feeling may just come with the territory of the flexibility of an API based approach and the wide array of application frameworks that can consume these APIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting topic that came up was the concept of content preview and managing editorial layouts. In the developer case studies portion of the summit we saw a number of attempted solutions to these problems, including an amazing offering from <a href="http://www.1xinternet.de/">1XInternet</a> that allowed content managed in Drupal to be edited in either the Drupal or React UI with updates syndicated in near real time. Wow factor aside, conversations later in the summit brought that entire approach into question. The counterpoint being that these editorial conveniences are page-centric in nature and thus won’t always make sense in a truly decoupled context. In this case we’re either putting in a large amount of effort to replicate the traditional coupled website editing experience, or this only represents one portion of the editorial experience we’re trying to manage.  It is understandable that we’re often falling back to the page centric approaches we’re familiar with, but this is more evidence that our approaches to decoupling are still maturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions during the summit also often crossed into two key initiatives...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Drupal community is pushing to modernize...</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2926656">The Javascript Modernization Initiative</a> looks to improve Drupal’s JavaScript by improving the experience of maintaining Drupal’s current JavaScript codebase, and also creating <a href="https://github.com/jsdrupal/drupal-admin-ui-demo">a new alternative admin UI for Drupal based in React</a>. The initiative has already introduced the AirBnB standards and a JavaScript build process to Drupal Core, but there are more welcome changes on the horizon. One focus area is improving Drupal’s JavaScript based test suite by phasing out the use of PhantomJS and transitioning to Nightwatch.js. They are also attempting to manage aspects of the project primarily on Github which I’d imagine would be a welcome change for many JavaScript developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another common theme that kept coming up is that the JS initiative has a small group working on these issues and could really use additional help. This is another area where I’d love to find a way to contribute in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to serving as a proof of concept for how Drupal might utilize React, this UI also crosses over nicely with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ideas/issues/2757967">the API-first initiative</a> since the alternative admin UI that is being developed depends on Drupal’s API.  The API-first initiative aims to advance Drupal’s web services in support of decoupling and other new types of integration. Closing gaps in Drupal’s API (file upload support was one that came up as a high priority for 8.6) that could support a decoupled admin UI would also make Drupal’s API more suitable for consumers outside of core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>…but there could be more alignment on how we’re approaching modernization</b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complete with its admittedly clickbait title, core conversation <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/farewell-twig">A Farewell to Twig</a> received the passionate discussion that the session appeared to be aiming for. This early and theoretical discussion focused on the concept of making client rendering a first class citizen in Drupal and potentially focusing more on decoupling rather than solving all aspects of front end development. One possible approach involved enhancing Drupal’s front end to be decoupled out of the box and then offering one or more decoupled front ends that could optionally be used with Drupal.  There were various theories on how far this would go - from shipping with a Twig front end by default (a common concern from the audience was related to continuing to support Twig for small to mid range projects, and also for general consistency) all the way to the concept of not shipping with a front end by default.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a thought provoking discussion that also sparked some dissonance with the other things I’d been hearing and thinking about throughout the conference. Much of Dries’ focus in his keynote was on improving the content creator and site builder experience, along with promoting Drupal to non-technical decision makers. This aligns nicely with the layout work (which also featured prominently in the keynote,) but it feels at odds with the focus within the community on decoupling. Can both directions be correct?  Should both efforts be happening in parallel? Should I just relax and enjoy all of the new functionality and improvements Drupal has to offer? No easy answers here, so <a href="https://fulldegreeheyyouau.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/why-not-both-animated-gif-7.gif?w=748">I’ll just link to a relevant meme</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tangentially related, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/stevector">Steve Persch</a> talked about Drupal’s mission statement compared to WordPress\' during the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/whats-possible-wordpress-50">What\'s possible with WordPress 5.0</a> presentation. Those missions are best summarized as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wordpress: Democratize publishing<br />\r\nDrupal: Ambitious Digital Experiences</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d agree that Drupal’s mission statement isn’t as easy to hang your hat on when compared to WordPress. And does ‘Ambitious Digital Experiences’ really represent what was focused on during the Driesnote?  I’m not so sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Presenting at DrupalCon was a ton of fun</b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also had the pleasure of presenting <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/hot-jamstack-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a>. This was my first time speaking at DrupalCon and I had a ton of fun doing so.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Probably my most interesting takeaway from the session was from an informal poll before the recording even started. The vast majority of people in the room either identified as being new to decoupled Drupal, or new to React. In fact, the vast majority was new to both. This seems to confirm my working theory that there are a lot of people interested in decoupled concepts in the Drupal community but are struggling to find a way to get started. I hope this talk provided a decent starting point and inspired some people to dive in and start experimenting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to everyone who attended, packed the room, and provided thoughts and feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0HOsc5nQtM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><b>This was my most social sprint experience</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This DrupalCon sprint was different for me in that I spent the majority of my time having some great conversations rather than actively writing code.

The highest priority projects that I needed to apply the security release to were on 8.4.5 at the time of the pre-announcement. I took this as a good opportunity to upgrade to 8.5 and then kind of got tunnel vision about getting these projects, and also my lower priority D8 projects up to 8.5 in preparation for the security release. Not having looked back at the security advisory since my initial read, I lost sight of the fact that I could easily apply the patch to their current D8 version and worry about 8.5 when the pressure was off a little bit.  Thankfully I was reminded of this during a well timed check in meeting with the Drupal practice at HS2 - a few of my 8.5 upgrades were a little behind schedule.  Having the flexibility to apply the security update to older versions of D8 really helped and most likely prevented us from rushing a few upgrade related regressions out into production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the 8.5 upgrade getting a bit behind schedule, minor Drupal updates (8.4, 8.5 and so on) are still more challenging than I\'d expect them to be.  Jeff Geerling\'s post <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Updating drupal/core with Composer - but Drupal core doesn\'t update</a> proved invaluable as I ran into the same issue. I also had another pretty tricky dependency conflict that eventually required me to remove and work around a dependency (again, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Jeff Geerling\'s post</a> helped quite a bit here.)  After successfully upgrading to 8.5 composer-wise, I found that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/page_manager/issues/2918564">a patch to Page Manager</a> needed to be applied for the site to even run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m getting better with managing Drupal projects via composer, but still have some room to grow.  Lowest hanging fruit is that I need to start managing patches via composer. Once that clicked in my brain it was a little to late to experiment with it.  Next time.  I also still sometimes get tripped up with the difference between the ^ and ~ version constraints in composer.json which is embarrassing to admit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also ran updates on Drupal instances based on API-first distributions. Those were a bit of a different beast. In my case, most were single purpose enough that I was able to just run composer update and call it a day.  That said, each distro had their quirks.  The version of <a href="https://github.com/acquia/reservoir">Reservoir</a> I was using had a dependency conflict that prevented the upgrade until I manually locked Reservoir at Alpha 4. <a href="http://www.contentacms.org/">Contenta</a> seems to have <a href="https://github.com/contentacms/contenta_jsonapi/issues/266">a patch that won\'t apply to 8.5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m all for learning, but also looking forward to this process becoming smoother sailing in the future.</p>'},relationships:{image:null},fields:{slug:"/note/drupal-8.5-and-security-updates/"},post_type:"note",created:1522418446}},{node:{id:"a96b9bb8-3afc-4fc8-9491-d3a4b62b85ea",title:"Shop Talk Show 303: JAM Stack with Phil Hawksworth",link:"http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/303-jam-stack-phil-hawksworth/",body:{value:"<p>A great listen that could serve as a solid introduction to the JAM Stack concept.

A Drupal Crash Course for Non-Developers.</a>’ While it\'s easy to get wrapped up in the new and advanced at a camp like this, it is also really important to see newcomers, beginners, and people with Drupal-adjacent roles take steps into becoming more hands on with the CMS. She specifically mentioned that the training helped her have some revelations about a few Drupal-isms that us crazy developers have been talking about all this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some really enjoyable traffic, Friday brought me to the first day of sessions.  A couple of highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/local-dev-environments-dummies">Local Dev Environments for Dummies</a> - the bulk of this presentation reviewed data from a 2018 Drupal Developer Survey, and the data alone was extremely fascinating. It also provided some interesting perspectives on Vagrant vs. Docker for local development (go Vagrant if matching your prod environment exactly is important, and Docker for pretty much everything else.) I also walked out of this one itching to learn more about <a href="https://docs.devwithlando.io/">Lando</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/decoupled-drupal-across-stack">Decoupled Drupal Across The Stack</a> - always enjoy seeing <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/prestonso">Preston</a> speak about Decoupled Drupal, and being aware of his (and Acquia’s) perspective on the topic is important if I’m going to be speaking about adjacent topics as well. A good talk for  someone looking to survey the current Decoupled Drupal landscape. Was interesting to see that all of the examples Preston provided included some server side universal JavaScript component to handle the initial page view. I’ve been working on learning more about the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM Stack</a> which specifically does not include JavaScript running on the server. Seeing examples of this alternative stack helped get me thinking more about the pros and cons of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/component-based-drupal">Component Based Drupal</a> - Surprise! After a cancellation, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/nerdstein">Adam Bergstein</a> and I stepped in without much of a safety net (I learned that I was co-presenting this session due to <a href="https://twitter.com/hook42inc/status/971837614004342784">a mention on twitter</a>) to talk about the current state of building and theming with components in Drupal. I’ve always enjoyed my conversations with Adam on this topic because while we primarily agree, we also have some differences of opinion and take some different approaches in our workflow. Continuing this conversation out in the open seemed to be useful to people, and I even got to joke around a little bit. I wouldn’t be surprised if Adam and I presented in a similar format in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUAVgejng9w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday - less traffic, more sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/oop-pokemon-journey">OOP - The Pokemon Journey</a> / <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/bending-behats-benefits-live-coding-adventure">Bending Behat\'s Benefits: A live coding adventure</a> - A journey followed by an adventure?

The OOP Pokemon Journey was a fun and easy to understand talk on a topic that I honestly don’t yet consider myself an expert on. And Bending Behat’s Benefits made me anxious to incorporate some more test driven development into my process after some time away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/too-many-cooks-supporting-augmented-teams-without-getting-salty">Too many cooks!

I’ve felt so much similar pain/joy on recent projects. They also closed with the reminder that we all need to look into how Layout Builder in 8.5 and the Layout Initiative will impact this process going forward, which I think is extremely important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/hot-jamstack-lessons-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Lessons from Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a> -This is my attempt to demystify the process of creating a decoupled app with Drupal and React by way of a fun side project.

We lose a bit of the protection that Drupal provided us from something like malformed markup in a body field making a page explode.

In my various roles as a developer, I often start out doing front end work, and then over time find myself doing predominantly back end work. This could be because back end work has a higher value at the places I've worked.  It also could be because I suck at front end and just don't know it (hopefully not that one.) It's almost as if what people take full stack to mean is that the developer is exaggerating about their skill level on either the front or back end of the stack. Or maybe that they just haven't figured out which end of the stack their real talent lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've always considered myself someone who prefers front end, so that is a bit of a challenging pattern to be stuck in.

I often describe myself as is a full stack developer with a preference for front end.  While that sounds kind of like a line from a personal ad, it does describe what I like to work on. I prefer front end work, can do back end work, and especially enjoy back end work  when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drilling down on that last part brings us to the section where perhaps I'm not being honest with myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I can do back end work, and especially enjoy it when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe my real thing is what lies in the middle.

Over the past year I\'ve been exploring <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and the world of <a href="https://dri.es/how-to-decouple-drupal-in-2018">Decoupled Drupal</a>. After working through <a href="http://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>\' <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React For Beginners</a> course and having some concepts finally click, I took another shot at creating <a href="http://brianperryinteractive.com/aoty-visualizations/">a web app based on the Album of the Year Project</a>. Having a project I could slowly chip away at over the year provided a great low pressure way to learn, and also prevented me from having to re-learn things as they vanished from my brain. I\'d love to duplicate that situation in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Next up learning wise I\'m planning on continuing my experimentation with the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> by way of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a>. I like what I\'ve seen of Gatsby thus far. It allows me to leverage all of the things I\'ve enjoyed about React, while combining that with the features of a static site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. And it plays nice with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/8">Drupal 8</a> as well, which is a plus.</p>\r\n<p>So welcome to my new Gatsby site. It will be nice to have an active personal website again, but perhaps even more exciting is the fact that this serves as another low pressure project I can chip away at throughout 2018 to learn more about React and decoupling Drupal. I\'ll start out with a site very close to nothing - little content, little styling - and slowly add new stuff as time and interest allows.</p>\r\n<p>With any luck this site will look completely different by the time 2019 approaches. And hopefully I will have learned a thing or two along the way.

It was an extremely well organized event attended by a bunch of super engaged and friendly Drupalers. A bit of a short trip for me as I had tickets to see <a href="https://www.hdtgminfo.com/">How Did This Get Made</a> back home on Saturday night, but that just resulted in things being focused around a couple of clear themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Visual Regression Testing</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visual Regression Testing is a topic I’ve been interested in quite a while now, but I’ve fallen out of practice as of late. I was really excited to see that there was a bunch of content on visual regression testing planned for the camp, much of which was focused around <a href="https://garris.github.io/BackstopJS/">BackstopJS</a>. I’ve tried a number of other solutions in the past (<a href="https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith">Wraith</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS">PhantomCSS</a>, <a href="http://webdriver.io/">WebDriverIO</a>) but not Backstop JS which seems to be gaining momentum in the Drupal community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday the folks at <a href="http://pantheon.io/">Pantheon</a> held a training session on BackstopJS, which I attended.  It provided a great overview of how they use the tool, along with some example repositories for learning. By the end of the training I had completed a first pass at adding a suite of regression tests to this blog. I would have liked to see a little more content in the training about the general functionality of BackstopJS rather than the Pantheon team’s use cases, but any training where I can walk out with a real world example implemented is a big win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing on the Backstop train I also doubled down and attended <a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/deploy-without-fear--visual-regression-testing-with-backstopjs-is-here">Ryan Bateman from Hook 42’s session on BackstopJS</a>. He provided a little more of the general functional overview that I was looking for after the training, and also talked about the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/backstop_generator">Backstop Generator</a> module that he had recently created. Backstop generator allows you to quickly create a backstop.json file that tests against specific pages on your site and/or a random selection of pages. Seems like a great way for Drupal projects to take advantage of BackstopJS with very little effort. It was also great getting a chance to talk with Ryan later on in the camp - I think he stands as the only Alaskan Drupalist I’ve ever met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to travel I wasn’t able to catch David Stinemetze from Rackspace’s related <a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/sessions/archiving-and-visual-regression-using-drupal-8">Archiving and Visual Regression Using Drupal 8</a> session, but I’m planning on catching up on the video later.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Community</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Texas Camp featured two very excellent keynotes that I was lucky enough to enjoy over breakfast burritos. Both are very much worth watching, so rather than try to recap, I’ll just paraphrase a few things that really stuck with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikki Stevens - <a href="https://2018.texascamp.org/happenings/keynote-breaking-the-binary-the-politics-of-code-and-inclusivity-in-technology">Breaking the Binary: The Politics of Code and Inclusivity in Technology</a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Diversity is being invited to the party.

And then Saturday night I met up with some old Boston friends and did the tourist-y <a href="http://www.batsinaustin.com/">bat bridge thing</a>, saw a fun band called <a href="http://www.quietcompanymusic.com/">Quiet Company</a> play at Stubbs BBQ, and closed out the night with some Austin food trucks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, a great trip.

I’m looking to test it with a variety of Pattern Lab instances - <a href-"https://github.com/backlineint/ui_patterns_pattern_lab/issues/2">can you help</a>?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we’ve run into each other at Drupal camps over the past couple of years, you’ve probably heard me talk about component based development and most likely also the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns">UI Patterns Module</a>. I’m a big supporter of a pattern library driven approach to building a Drupal site, but also feel that some common practices can be complicated - especially for those new to the approach or those not focused on the front end. In my opinion, UI Patterns can reduce that complexity quite a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the UI Patterns module came along it seemed too good to be true. It allowed patterns to be formally defined as Drupal plugins and took the data mapping that was commonly happening behind the scenes in Twig templates and exposed these in the admin UI where a wider audience could configure and understand them.  But if you were using an external pattern library in your project, configuring these patterns for use with the UI Patterns module felt a little redundant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a> for example you would commonly have a json or yaml file that specified sample data for each of the fields in your pattern. Much of that same data would be once again defined in the yaml file for the related UI Pattern in Drupal. The UI Patterns project has always envisioned that there would eventually be supporting modules that could automatically discover patterns from pattern libraries like Pattern Lab and Fractal, which would make it unnecessary to re-define patterns for use with Drupal. The module even contains classes that could be extended for this purpose. But similar to my initial feelings about the module, that just sounded too good to be true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I should have seen this coming, but it might not be too good to be true after all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On an issue in the UI Patterns repository, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/pdureau">Pierre Dureau</a> shared his work creating such an integration module for use with UI Patterns and Fractal. It made a lot of sense to me when I looked at the code, and seemed like something that would be reasonable to adapt to a Pattern Lab version. I asked around to see if folks would be cool with me taking a shot at that, and the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_pattern_lab">UI Patterns Pattern Lab module</a> was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs of now, UI Patterns Pattern Lab supports the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Discovering UI Patterns that exist in the templates directory in any module or theme, or any custom twig namespace defined in a theme. Discovered patterns must have a pattern definition file in json or yaml, and a related twig template.</li>\r\n<li>Creating a library that includes css or js assets associated with your pattern.</li>\r\n<li>Parsing documentation from a related pattern documentation markdown file.</li>\r\n<li>Overriding default discovery behavior via variables in the pattern definition file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More detailed documentation is available in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/ui-patterns-pattern-lab">the documentation guide on Drupal.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the call for help part…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that the more Pattern Lab instances we can test this against, the more useful it can be (I did some initial testing using Emulsify and was able to fix a handful of bugs as a result.) If you have a Pattern Lab instance that you’d be willing to try with the module (or even just one you’d be willing to share with me), it would be a huge help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a wide variety of ways to configure patterns in Pattern Lab, so don’t be surprised if your pattern library is the one that causes the module to blow up. Also, the thing I’m struggling with right now is how realistic is is to use this with an existing pattern lab instance, especially ones that were set up to do a lot of complicated mapping in twig templates. It remains to be seen if the real use of this module would be with existing pattern lab instance, or along side a pattern library built with this approach in mind. Hopefully after putting this through the paces with a handful of Pattern Lab instances a trend will become obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d appreciate any of the help you or your pattern library can lend here. Feel free to get in touch, or <a href="https://github.com/backlineint/ui_patterns_pattern_lab/issues/2">comment on this github issue</a>. Thanks!</p>'

Better get it in writing before the remaining echoes of country music drown it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My most important takeaway from my trip was that the Nashville Predators let fans smash a car painted with the opponents logo before games. Beyond that, I did also learn some things while at DrupalCon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>There is a lot of excitement behind Layout Builder and layout related initiatives</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the Layout Initiative was able to accomplish with the release of Layout Builder as an experimental module in Drupal 8.5 was extremely impressive.  It is a great foundation that the initiative already appears to have clear plans to flesh out and improve.  It was promising to see many well attended sessions on this topic, coverage in the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/driesnote">Driesnote</a>, and quite a bit of excitement about layouts and Layout Builder buzzing through the halls of Music City Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest gap I see in what exists thus far is the disconnect between the block based layout builder and the blocks UI. You currently have to leave the layout builder interface to create new custom blocks before you can add them to a layout, and these blocks have the potential to flood the main Drupal custom blocks UI.  I was very happy to hear that there is <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2948064">an issue related to inline creation of custom blocks</a> that should help bridge this gap. In a BOF on Components and The Layout Initiative <a href="http://bit.ly/components-layout">a number of other relevant issues were identified</a> that could potentially improve the experience and make Layout Builder play even more nicely with component based workflows. I’m hoping to follow along with these, go hands on frequently, and help out where I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Many are decoupling, but approaches vary</b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>To poorly paraphrase <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mrjmd">Matt Davis</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Many people build websites this way outside of the Drupal world, they just don’t call it decoupled</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a lot of great discussion at the Decoupled Summit (<a href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/decoupled-drupal-summit-at-drupalcon">Lullabot has a good recap</a>) but also a feeling that while decoupling continues to gain momentum in the Drupal community, there are still a wide variety of strategies and some alignment on best practices yet to come. That said, I think some of that feeling may just come with the territory of the flexibility of an API based approach and the wide array of application frameworks that can consume these APIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting topic that came up was the concept of content preview and managing editorial layouts. In the developer case studies portion of the summit we saw a number of attempted solutions to these problems, including an amazing offering from <a href="http://www.1xinternet.de/">1XInternet</a> that allowed content managed in Drupal to be edited in either the Drupal or React UI with updates syndicated in near real time. Wow factor aside, conversations later in the summit brought that entire approach into question. The counterpoint being that these editorial conveniences are page-centric in nature and thus won’t always make sense in a truly decoupled context. In this case we’re either putting in a large amount of effort to replicate the traditional coupled website editing experience, or this only represents one portion of the editorial experience we’re trying to manage.  It is understandable that we’re often falling back to the page centric approaches we’re familiar with, but this is more evidence that our approaches to decoupling are still maturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions during the summit also often crossed into two key initiatives...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Drupal community is pushing to modernize...</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2926656">The Javascript Modernization Initiative</a> looks to improve Drupal’s JavaScript by improving the experience of maintaining Drupal’s current JavaScript codebase, and also creating <a href="https://github.com/jsdrupal/drupal-admin-ui-demo">a new alternative admin UI for Drupal based in React</a>. The initiative has already introduced the AirBnB standards and a JavaScript build process to Drupal Core, but there are more welcome changes on the horizon. One focus area is improving Drupal’s JavaScript based test suite by phasing out the use of PhantomJS and transitioning to Nightwatch.js. They are also attempting to manage aspects of the project primarily on Github which I’d imagine would be a welcome change for many JavaScript developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another common theme that kept coming up is that the JS initiative has a small group working on these issues and could really use additional help. This is another area where I’d love to find a way to contribute in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to serving as a proof of concept for how Drupal might utilize React, this UI also crosses over nicely with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/ideas/issues/2757967">the API-first initiative</a> since the alternative admin UI that is being developed depends on Drupal’s API.  The API-first initiative aims to advance Drupal’s web services in support of decoupling and other new types of integration. Closing gaps in Drupal’s API (file upload support was one that came up as a high priority for 8.6) that could support a decoupled admin UI would also make Drupal’s API more suitable for consumers outside of core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>…but there could be more alignment on how we’re approaching modernization</b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complete with its admittedly clickbait title, core conversation <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/farewell-twig">A Farewell to Twig</a> received the passionate discussion that the session appeared to be aiming for. This early and theoretical discussion focused on the concept of making client rendering a first class citizen in Drupal and potentially focusing more on decoupling rather than solving all aspects of front end development. One possible approach involved enhancing Drupal’s front end to be decoupled out of the box and then offering one or more decoupled front ends that could optionally be used with Drupal.  There were various theories on how far this would go - from shipping with a Twig front end by default (a common concern from the audience was related to continuing to support Twig for small to mid range projects, and also for general consistency) all the way to the concept of not shipping with a front end by default.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a thought provoking discussion that also sparked some dissonance with the other things I’d been hearing and thinking about throughout the conference. Much of Dries’ focus in his keynote was on improving the content creator and site builder experience, along with promoting Drupal to non-technical decision makers. This aligns nicely with the layout work (which also featured prominently in the keynote,) but it feels at odds with the focus within the community on decoupling. Can both directions be correct?  Should both efforts be happening in parallel? Should I just relax and enjoy all of the new functionality and improvements Drupal has to offer? No easy answers here, so <a href="https://fulldegreeheyyouau.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/why-not-both-animated-gif-7.gif?w=748">I’ll just link to a relevant meme</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tangentially related, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/stevector">Steve Persch</a> talked about Drupal’s mission statement compared to WordPress\' during the <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/whats-possible-wordpress-50">What\'s possible with WordPress 5.0</a> presentation. Those missions are best summarized as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wordpress: Democratize publishing<br />\r\nDrupal: Ambitious Digital Experiences</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d agree that Drupal’s mission statement isn’t as easy to hang your hat on when compared to WordPress. And does ‘Ambitious Digital Experiences’ really represent what was focused on during the Driesnote?  I’m not so sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Presenting at DrupalCon was a ton of fun</b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also had the pleasure of presenting <a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/hot-jamstack-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a>. This was my first time speaking at DrupalCon and I had a ton of fun doing so.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Probably my most interesting takeaway from the session was from an informal poll before the recording even started. The vast majority of people in the room either identified as being new to decoupled Drupal, or new to React. In fact, the vast majority was new to both. This seems to confirm my working theory that there are a lot of people interested in decoupled concepts in the Drupal community but are struggling to find a way to get started. I hope this talk provided a decent starting point and inspired some people to dive in and start experimenting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to everyone who attended, packed the room, and provided thoughts and feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0HOsc5nQtM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><b>This was my most social sprint experience</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This DrupalCon sprint was different for me in that I spent the majority of my time having some great conversations rather than actively writing code. I finally had a chance to meet <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/kclarkson">Kaleem Clarkson</a> face to face and talk about how he’s been using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/foundation_patterns">Foundation Patterns theme</a>.

I also walked out of this one itching to learn more about <a href="https://docs.devwithlando.io/">Lando</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/decoupled-drupal-across-stack">Decoupled Drupal Across The Stack</a> - always enjoy seeing <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/prestonso">Preston</a> speak about Decoupled Drupal, and being aware of his (and Acquia’s) perspective on the topic is important if I’m going to be speaking about adjacent topics as well. A good talk for  someone looking to survey the current Decoupled Drupal landscape. Was interesting to see that all of the examples Preston provided included some server side universal JavaScript component to handle the initial page view. I’ve been working on learning more about the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAM Stack</a> which specifically does not include JavaScript running on the server. Seeing examples of this alternative stack helped get me thinking more about the pros and cons of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/component-based-drupal">Component Based Drupal</a> - Surprise! After a cancellation, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/nerdstein">Adam Bergstein</a> and I stepped in without much of a safety net (I learned that I was co-presenting this session due to <a href="https://twitter.com/hook42inc/status/971837614004342784">a mention on twitter</a>) to talk about the current state of building and theming with components in Drupal. I’ve always enjoyed my conversations with Adam on this topic because while we primarily agree, we also have some differences of opinion and take some different approaches in our workflow. Continuing this conversation out in the open seemed to be useful to people, and I even got to joke around a little bit. I wouldn’t be surprised if Adam and I presented in a similar format in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUAVgejng9w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturday - less traffic, more sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/oop-pokemon-journey">OOP - The Pokemon Journey</a> / <a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/bending-behats-benefits-live-coding-adventure">Bending Behat\'s Benefits: A live coding adventure</a> - A journey followed by an adventure?

The OOP Pokemon Journey was a fun and easy to understand talk on a topic that I honestly don’t yet consider myself an expert on. And Bending Behat’s Benefits made me anxious to incorporate some more test driven development into my process after some time away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/too-many-cooks-supporting-augmented-teams-without-getting-salty">Too many cooks!

I’ve felt so much similar pain/joy on recent projects. They also closed with the reminder that we all need to look into how Layout Builder in 8.5 and the Layout Initiative will impact this process going forward, which I think is extremely important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.midcamp.org/topic/hot-jamstack-lessons-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Lessons from Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a> -This is my attempt to demystify the process of creating a decoupled app with Drupal and React by way of a fun side project.

I tried a new Gatsby build and saw the same thing. Next, I zeroed in on the post where content started overlapping and eventually noticed that I had some malformed markup in my post in Drupal - a missing closing quote for a href attribute. After updating the post to add the missing quote and doing another build, everything was fine again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could chalk most of this up to me - if I was using a wysiwyg editor it would have added the correct link markup for me, and I should probably be taking a closer look at my build after it goes to GitHub Pages. But I think this hiccup was a nice reminder of the reality of these super sexy decoupled architectures. We lose a bit of the protection that Drupal provided us from something like malformed markup in a body field making a page explode.  Builds will break in ways that they didn\'t with Drupal alone - the site worked fine in development mode but broke when the production bundle was built. And while testing is always important, we likely need to test in ways that are different from when we were testing Drupal by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lessons to be learned even in the dumbest of problems. I\'m sure I\'ll run into some more.</p>'

The main reason that I don't like the term is because I feel like it doesn't mean that much to people. \r\n Full stack developer kind of feels like someone saying 'I'll do whatever'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm not sure if it is directly related to being a full stack developer, but over the years I've seen a pattern in how I'm utilized. In my various roles as a developer, I often start out doing front end work, and then over time find myself doing predominantly back end work. This could be because back end work has a higher value at the places I've worked.  It also could be because I suck at front end and just don't know it (hopefully not that one.) It's almost as if what people take full stack to mean is that the developer is exaggerating about their skill level on either the front or back end of the stack. Or maybe that they just haven't figured out which end of the stack their real talent lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've always considered myself someone who prefers front end, so that is a bit of a challenging pattern to be stuck in. But lately I've been wondering, am I not being honest with myself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I'm just describing myself wrong. I often describe myself as is a full stack developer with a preference for front end.  While that sounds kind of like a line from a personal ad, it does describe what I like to work on. I prefer front end work, can do back end work, and especially enjoy back end work  when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drilling down on that last part brings us to the section where perhaps I'm not being honest with myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I can do back end work, and especially enjoy it when it is in service of making front end work possible or better.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe my real thing is what lies in the middle.

The process of putting together a session submission is always an interesting one for me. For DrupalCon it is usually a wonderful mix of overanalyzing, combined with good old fashioned imposter syndrome. That said, I feel like I improve each time around, and I think these are my strongest proposals yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission one was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">Component Based Theming with UI Patterns</a>.\' <a href="https://nedcamp.org/new-england-drupal-camp/sessions/component-based-theming-ui-patterns">I\'ve given this talk before</a> and was happy with how it turned out.

In hindsight, I should have reached out to him and seen if there was any way to collaborate as he ended up joining up with another speaker for his session. Lesson learned for next time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission two was \'<a href="https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/hot-jamstack-lessons-learned-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react">Hot JAMS(tack): Lessons from Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a>.\' Strong competition as well here with many Decoupled Drupal and React related topics, but Im hoping I have a slightly different angle that might garner some interest. True to my usual form, I also went with a goofy, high-concept approach with the submission. Almost got cold feet about going in that direction, but decided I\'d rather have fun with it. Ironically, with a proposal that heavily references music, I didn\'t even make the Music City connection until writing this post. Would have been fun to play that angle up more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be my third time submitting sessions to DrupalCon North America (which I guess is now just DrupalCon?)

Happy 2018!</p>\r\n<p>It could be another case of New Years delusion, but this year I think the timing might actually make sense. Over the past year I\'ve been exploring <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and the world of <a href="https://dri.es/how-to-decouple-drupal-in-2018">Decoupled Drupal</a>. After working through <a href="http://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>\' <a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React For Beginners</a> course and having some concepts finally click, I took another shot at creating <a href="http://brianperryinteractive.com/aoty-visualizations/">a web app based on the Album of the Year Project</a>. Having a project I could slowly chip away at over the year provided a great low pressure way to learn, and also prevented me from having to re-learn things as they vanished from my brain. I\'d love to duplicate that situation in 2018.</p>\r\n<p>Next up learning wise I\'m planning on continuing my experimentation with the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> by way of <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a>. I like what I\'ve seen of Gatsby thus far. It allows me to leverage all of the things I\'ve enjoyed about React, while combining that with the features of a static site generator like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a>. And it plays nice with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/8">Drupal 8</a> as well, which is a plus.</p>\r\n<p>So welcome to my new Gatsby site. It will be nice to have an active personal website again, but perhaps even more exciting is the fact that this serves as another low pressure project I can chip away at throughout 2018 to learn more about React and decoupling Drupal. I\'ll start out with a site very close to nothing - little content, little styling - and slowly add new stuff as time and interest allows.</p>\r\n<p>With any luck this site will look completely different by the time 2019 approaches.

You’re better off just using the image markup Drupal renders, even if it isn\'t exactly as clean as you want it to be. Sometimes not fighting this battle at all is the right way to go.

The highest priority projects that I needed to apply the security release to were on 8.4.5 at the time of the pre-announcement. I took this as a good opportunity to upgrade to 8.5 and then kind of got tunnel vision about getting these projects, and also my lower priority D8 projects up to 8.5 in preparation for the security release. Not having looked back at the security advisory since my initial read, I lost sight of the fact that I could easily apply the patch to their current D8 version and worry about 8.5 when the pressure was off a little bit.  Thankfully I was reminded of this during a well timed check in meeting with the Drupal practice at HS2 - a few of my 8.5 upgrades were a little behind schedule.  Having the flexibility to apply the security update to older versions of D8 really helped and most likely prevented us from rushing a few upgrade related regressions out into production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of the 8.5 upgrade getting a bit behind schedule, minor Drupal updates (8.4, 8.5 and so on) are still more challenging than I\'d expect them to be.  Jeff Geerling\'s post <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Updating drupal/core with Composer - but Drupal core doesn\'t update</a> proved invaluable as I ran into the same issue. I also had another pretty tricky dependency conflict that eventually required me to remove and work around a dependency (again, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2018/updating-drupalcore-composer-drupal-core-doesnt-update">Jeff Geerling\'s post</a> helped quite a bit here.)  After successfully upgrading to 8.5 composer-wise, I found that <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/page_manager/issues/2918564">a patch to Page Manager</a> needed to be applied for the site to even run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m getting better with managing Drupal projects via composer, but still have some room to grow.  Lowest hanging fruit is that I need to start managing patches via composer. Once that clicked in my brain it was a little to late to experiment with it.  Next time.  I also still sometimes get tripped up with the difference between the ^ and ~ version constraints in composer.json which is embarrassing to admit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also ran updates on Drupal instances based on API-first distributions. Those were a bit of a different beast. In my case, most were single purpose enough that I was able to just run composer update and call it a day.  That said, each distro had their quirks.  The version of <a href="https://github.com/acquia/reservoir">Reservoir</a> I was using had a dependency conflict that prevented the upgrade until I manually locked Reservoir at Alpha 4. <a href="http://www.contentacms.org/">Contenta</a> seems to have <a href="https://github.com/contentacms/contenta_jsonapi/issues/266">a patch that won\'t apply to 8.5</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m all for learning, but also looking forward to this process becoming smoother sailing in the future.</p>'},relationships:{image:null},fields:{slug:"/note/drupal-8.5-and-security-updates/"},post_type:"note",created:1522418446}},{node:{id:"ade692cf-10ab-4868-837c-f3aa646f518d",title:"CSS Tricks Rabbit Hole",body:{value:'<p>Went down a bit of a CSS-Tricks rabbit hole over lunch today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Started with <a href="https://css-tricks.com/complexity/">Complexity.</a> I\'ve enjoyed all of the recent point / counterpoints about the increasing complexity of front end development.
