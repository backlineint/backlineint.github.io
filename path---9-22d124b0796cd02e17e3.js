Possibly just one of my favorite <em>things</em> of all time. I don't like U2 all that much, yet somehow hearing Scott and Scott break down U2's entire discography over 24 episodes was something I saved for special occasions and often laughed to the point of tears while listening to. And boy, did they ever spend a lot of time talking about the band U2 (not really.)  They even knew the names of every single member of the band. Truly encyclopedic knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now Scott and Scott are back with '<a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/show/u-talkin-u2-to-me/\">R U Talkin' R.E.M. RE: ME?</a>' in which they explore the output of the band R.E.M in what I'm sure will be painstaking detail. I like R.E.M. more than I like U2, but I can't say I would ever want to go through their entire back catalog. Yet somehow here we are again, and I'm excited to hear all about the album Monster. Listening today was just like old times. Can't wait to save for long road trips and laugh to the point of nearly driving off the road.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>If you're looking for more info on what the hell this is all about, this <a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/1981761/talkin-to-scott-aukerman-re-u-talkin-r-e-m-re-me/franchises/interview/\">Stereogum interview</a> is as good a place as any.

I tried a new Gatsby build and saw the same thing. Next, I zeroed in on the post where content started overlapping and eventually noticed that I had some malformed markup in my post in Drupal - a missing closing quote for a href attribute. After updating the post to add the missing quote and doing another build, everything was fine again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could chalk most of this up to me - if I was using a wysiwyg editor it would have added the correct link markup for me, and I should probably be taking a closer look at my build after it goes to GitHub Pages. But I think this hiccup was a nice reminder of the reality of these super sexy decoupled architectures. We lose a bit of the protection that Drupal provided us from something like malformed markup in a body field making a page explode.  Builds will break in ways that they didn\'t with Drupal alone - the site worked fine in development mode but broke when the production bundle was built. And while testing is always important, we likely need to test in ways that are different from when we were testing Drupal by itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lessons to be learned even in the dumbest of problems.
