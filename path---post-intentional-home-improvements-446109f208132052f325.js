I usually have a pretty good handle on what I want to accomplish in the upcoming year, along with a formal resolution. But this year, nothing. Initially that seemed terrifying, but the more I think about it, that openness and lack of expectation is an exciting resolution in and of itself.</p>\r\n<p>Standing in my now <em>mostly</em> finished kitchen I also came up with another late breaking resolution. 2019 is going to be the year of intentional home improvements. Rather than letting a flood force me into it, I'm going to try to proactively decorate, improve and declutter. It is pleasantly (mostly) non-technical, and I can tackle it in tiny chunks throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p>Wishing everyone a happy and productive 2019 full of dry kitchens.</p> "},relationships:{image:{localFile:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:1.3325545171339563,src:"/static/7a2b1cec12f214827ef01ed3e15f2d23-7c055d5d32f2a1563d7bb76c82bf418c-42807.jpg",srcSet:"/static/7a2b1cec12f214827ef01ed3e15f2d23-7c055d5d32f2a1563d7bb76c82bf418c-960f9.jpg 313w,\n/static/7a2b1cec12f214827ef01ed3e15f2d23-7c055d5d32f2a1563d7bb76c82bf418c-c36f2.jpg 625w,\n/static/7a2b1cec12f214827ef01ed3e15f2d23-7c055d5d32f2a1563d7bb76c82bf418c-42807.jpg 1250w,\n/static/7a2b1cec12f214827ef01ed3e15f2d23-7c055d5d32f2a1563d7bb76c82bf418c-dbc5e.jpg 1875w,\n/static/7a2b1cec12f214827ef01ed3e15f2d23-7c055d5d32f2a1563d7bb76c82bf418c-6e234.jpg 2500w,\n/static/7a2b1cec12f214827ef01ed3e15f2d23-7c055d5d32f2a1563d7bb76c82bf418c-98489.jpg 3422w",sizes:"(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px"}}}}},created:1546524528}},pathContext:{slug:"/post/intentional-home-improvements/"}}}});
