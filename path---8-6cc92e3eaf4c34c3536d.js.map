It’s next up in the YouTube queue.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.midcamp.org/topic/american-medical-association-topic-landing-pages-d8-case-study\\\">American Medical Association: Topic Landing Pages (A D8 Case Study)</a> - an excellent, and extremely relatable talk about the challenges of Drupal 8 landing page building integrated with a pattern library based approach to theming. I’ve felt so much similar pain/joy on recent projects. They also closed with the reminder that we all need to look into how Layout Builder in 8.5 and the Layout Initiative will impact this process going forward, which I think is extremely important.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.midcamp.org/topic/hot-jamstack-lessons-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react\\\">Hot JAMS(tack): Lessons from Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React</a> -This is my attempt to demystify the process of creating a decoupled app with Drupal and React by way of a fun side project. It was my first time giving a talk that I’ve had brewing for a while, and I was happy with how it went. Heard a lot of positive and helpful feedback and have a few things that I think I can tweak to make it more useful for people. Looking forward to presenting it again <a href=\\\"https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018/sessions/hot-jamstack-building-music-discovery-app-drupal-and-react\\\">at DrupalCon Nashville</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Plus, this was pretty cool:\\r\\n<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Funny slide! <a href=\\\"https://t.co/LLqwuVXFb3\\\">https://t.co/LLqwuVXFb3</a></p>&mdash; Dries Buytaert (@Dries) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/Dries/status/972816373545127936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\\\">March 11, 2018</a></blockquote>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sj_nE2IukOs\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sunday was sprints, and unfortunately more traffic on the way home.  I was dragging a little bit at this point, but still feel like I was able to get a few things done. I got back to the <a href=\\\"https://www.drupal.org/project/foundation_patterns\\\">Foundation Patterns</a> theme and responded to the first issue submitted against the project. I helped <a href=\\\"https://www.drupal.org/u/amklose\\\">Tony Klose</a> set up a Pattern Lab instance for a Drupal theme, and realized that I don’t have a clear personal process for including a pattern library as an external dependency of a theme.

Creating a component from scratch the instinct is often to pass in src and alt values as variables to get the cleanest markup possible. You can get that stuff out of Drupal, but it really is a pain. You’re better off just using the image markup Drupal renders, even if it isn't exactly as clean as you want it to be. Sometimes not fighting this battle at all is the right way to go. But if you want the perfect markup this post has everything you need to do it the right way.</p>\"},\"relationships\":{\"image\":null},\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/link/accommodating-drupal-in-your-components/\"},\"post_type\":\"link\",\"created\":1519510711}}],\"pathPrefix\":\"\",\"first\":false,\"last\":false,\"index\":8,\"pageCount\":12,\"additionalContext\":{}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/8.json\n// module id = 1108\n// module chunks = 124787695326054"],"sourceRoot":""}
